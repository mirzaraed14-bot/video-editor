# window-grab.sh — screenshot an app's window WITHOUT bringing it to the front.
#
#   ./workflows/window-grab.sh Premiere /tmp/pr.png     # biggest Premiere window
#   ./workflows/window-grab.sh Premiere /tmp/pr.png 3   # 3rd-biggest (panels, dialogs)
#   ./workflows/window-grab.sh --list Premiere          # just enumerate windows
#
# Why: the user works in other apps while Claude drives Premiere. `open -a` steals
# focus and interrupts them; `screencapture -D <display>` only sees whatever is
# on top. `screencapture -l<windowID>` captures the window's OWN buffer, so an
# occluded (or fully covered) window still grabs correctly.
#
# Window IDs come from CGWindowListCopyWindowInfo via a tiny inline Swift
# program — no pip installs, no pyobjc (system python3 has no Quartz module).
# Needs Screen Recording permission, which is already granted for screencapture.
#
# Caveat: a MINIMIZED window has no live buffer and grabs blank/stale. Windows
# on another macOS Space are still captured (we do not use optionOnScreenOnly).
