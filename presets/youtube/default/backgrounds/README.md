# Backgrounds — the two standard full-screen fields

The go-to backdrops for full-screen graphics on the youtube-default preset. Locked
2026-08-29 (you dialed both live against the Premiere monitor). Anything else is
opt-in by name.

- **`bg-light`** — light-gray radial field (`#f2f3f6` → `#dde0e7`), a feathered
  navy-tinted vignette (7 eased stops, corners land ~45% darker than center, no visible
  onset ring), and **film grain baked in** (luma-only temporal noise, strength 7 — real
  moving grain, added as an ffmpeg post-pass in render.sh).
- **`bg-dark`** — the brand navy field, two steps darker than the card token
  (`#060c1d` → `#010308`), 100px brand grid at 9% alpha, grid fading out under its own
  edge vignette. No grain.

🔒 **THIS IS THE HOME OF THE FIELD/FLAGS PAIRING. Any full-screen comp built ON bg-dark carries
the GLOW pass AND renders 12 fps style** (`STEP_FPS=12`) — the two travel together as the
dark-field treatment, and **bg-light full-screens get neither** (2026-08-31; glow level
locked at subtle 0.26). Pick the field and the flags follow. The glow's CSS recipe and the
two-layer sync pattern live in `../creative-moves.md` move 2.
The grid is a SIBLING layer in these comps — any dim/blur tween on the content must
name it too (`'.wall, #grid'`), or it stays sharp while everything else recedes.

## Rendering

```
./render.sh              # both → renders/bg-{light,dark}.mp4  (6s, 1920×1080)
./render.sh bg-light     # one
VER=b ./render.sh bg-light   # versioned — NEVER re-render onto a placed path
GRAIN=0 ./render.sh          # skip the grain pass; GRAIN_STRENGTH=7 is the knob
FPS=30000/1001               # default; match the timeline when it matters
```

**What a full-screen comp actually consumes is the CSS field, not these mp4s** — it bakes the
gradient + vignette into the comp (`../creative-moves.md` move 2), so `renders/` is a
preview/bed artifact: look at it, loop it behind something, ignore it otherwise.

**Renders are regenerable cache, not committed** — the grain makes bg-light ~88MB
(temporal noise defeats the encoder), so the comps + this script are the source of
truth; rebuild in ~90s per asset. For a longer bed than 6s, loop the clip in the
editor or bump `data-duration` and re-render.

## The vignette lesson (2026-08-29, cost three flat iterations)

Vignette intensity lives in the PIXELS, not the alpha values: with a big gradient
ellipse (105%+) the far stops land OUTSIDE the frame, so raising the corner alpha does
nearly nothing on screen — three "more intense" bumps moved the measured corner 5 luma
total while looking identical. Keep the ellipse small enough that the full ramp lands
inside the frame (78% 72% here), and verify a change by SAMPLING the render's corner
pixels against the previous version, not by re-reading the CSS.
