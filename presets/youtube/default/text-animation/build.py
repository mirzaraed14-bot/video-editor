"""build.py — basic TEXT ANIMATIONS (the youtube-default preset).

Word-synced emphasis text: each word RISES in and eases to rest, timed to the
spoken word. The entrance is `riseIn` — these are NOT the `pop` scale preset,
which is a special case a spec has to ask for by name (2026-08-31). The default sprinkle-in graphic — when nothing else is
called for, a text animation is the move. Locked 2026-08-29; layout rules
re-dialed same day (bigger, lower, line-balanced — your spacing pass).

THE LOCK is the animation + the fonts: Helvetica Bold lowercase (tight tracking)
as the standard, Playfair Display Italic w700 as the emphasis font for power
words, a small rise on power3.out (fast off the mark, long settle), NO fade-in,
each word led 80 ms ahead of its transcript timestamp so the settle lands on
the audio.

THE LAYOUT LAW (2026-08-29; the band re-measured 2026-08-31):
- THE LOW BAND is the hard frame: the whole block lives between TOP_MIN and
  BOTTOM_MAX and NOTHING is allowed out of it. Type size is what gives — a
  block that does not fit is scaled down until it does. This is why a
  one-liner and a two-liner are not the same size: two lines in the same
  band means smaller type, and that is correct, not a compromise.
- The block sits LOW inside the band: vertically centered halfway between the
  chin and the bottom edge (cy 850, a touch under halfway), never on the face.
- It fills the screen: each line is sized to a target width (default 1250px),
  so the type takes real estate instead of floating small — but the band wins
  when the two disagree.
- Lines BALANCE: every line is solved to the same width — a short last line
  automatically gets bigger type (the "one big word in the emphasis font"
  look), so a two-line block reads as a clean rectangle.
- Emphasis sprinkling: mark 0-2 power words with *asterisks* in the phrase and
  they set in Playfair Italic (x-height parity, ×1.033). Don't force it.

Usage: copy this folder into projects/<job>/hf-graphics/text-animation/, write
text.json, ./render.sh. Word timings come straight from the job's canonical
transcript — never retyped, never re-transcribed.

text.json — one entry per text animation:
  {
    "p1": {
      "phrase": "this video that you're watching *right now*",
      "lines": ["this video that you're watching", "*right now*"],
      "pos": "center",      // center | left | right  (sides = beside the face)
      "width": 1500,        // target line width px (the fill-the-screen knob)
      "cy": 850,            // block vertical center (center pos only)
      "y": null,            // explicit block top px — overrides cy
      "color": "#eef4ff",   // ink; black variant: "#111"
      "glow": true,         // kill when the text already contrasts with the bg
      "size": null,         // fixed font px — disables width-solving entirely
      "hold": 0.7,          // s between the last word landing and the fade-out
      "occurrence": 1       // which match of the phrase in the transcript
    }
  }
Only "phrase" is required. Display text is used AS TYPED (so a capitalized
proper noun stays capitalized); transcript matching is case/punct-insensitive.
A pop must never bleed across a V1 cut — trim the placed clip to the edit.

build.py [ids...] emits compositions/<id>.html and prints WHERE on the timeline
to place each pop (also saved to compositions/<id>.meta.json). The job folder is
auto-derived from this folder's location; pass --job <dir> to override.
