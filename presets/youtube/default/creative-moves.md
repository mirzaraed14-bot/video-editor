# Creative Moves — the default editing vocabulary

**This is what "edit this video" produces, unprompted.** Locked 2026-08-29 off the
your-job intro — you dialed every move live, and the finished first clip IS the
quality bar (see the README's Definition of Done). These moves are the DEFAULT for
youtube/default: reach for them on your own; don't wait for instructions.

Read with [`animations.md`](animations.md) (entrance vocabulary),
[`text-animation/text-animation-style.md`](text-animation/text-animation-style.md) (type system + layout law),
[`backgrounds/README.md`](backgrounds/README.md) (the two locked fields).

## The moves

### 1. Text animation — the default sprinkle (use liberally)
Word-synced animated text on the A-roll for emphasized phrases or dead stretches.
**When nothing else is called for, a text animation is the move.** Built by
`text-animation/build.py` (copy the folder in, write text.json); the builder carries the whole
layout law. Emphasis font on 0-2 power words via `*asterisks*`. A text animation NEVER
bleeds across a V1 cut — trim the placed clip to the edit.

**It lives in THE LOW BAND like every other under-the-face overlay** —
the builder enforces it, so a two-line block comes out smaller and lower than a one-liner
by construction. Full spec + how to re-derive the band per shoot:
[`default-overlay-style.md`](default-overlay-style.md) § THE LOW BAND.

### 2. Cut-to-graphic — the punch cut (key claims)
On a power phrase, hard-cut the footage to a **full-screen graphic on a locked
background** — **bg-dark is the default field; bg-light is the accent, for the visual that
reads better on it (2026-09-10)** — and hard-cut back — no fades, ever.
**Pick the field; the locked render flags follow from it** —
[`backgrounds/README.md`](backgrounds/README.md) is the home for that pairing.
**A full-screen has no face to clear, so THE LOW BAND does not apply: it sits DEAD CENTRE,
a tad smaller (2026-09-10: a full-screen graphic is always centred unless there is a
specific reason otherwise).** One transform on the content layer does it and keeps the glow
clone pixel-synced — `transform:scale(0.92); transform-origin:50% 50%` on `#content,#bloom` —
with the content's own box centred in the 1080 frame first (equal top and bottom margins:
a 10 px bias in the box is a 9 px bias on screen). The first lock (2026-08-31) also carried
`translateY(40px)`, "a touch low"; retired on your-job, 2026-09-10, where the
40 px read as a mistake, not as a choice.
Child GSAP transforms compose with it, so entrances and floats need no rework.
**Two reference implementations ship in this preset.** Both ship on bg-LIGHT. The OBJECT one,
"edited by Claude"
([`reference/punch-cut-reference.html`](reference/punch-cut-reference.html), your-job),
is the model for an ARTIFACT or a process — hero, caption, draw-on arrow, scene-slide. No bg-dark
comp ships as a reference: build a dark full-screen from either file and ADD the dark-field
treatment on top (the `#content` + `#bloom` clone at 0.26 and `STEP_FPS=12`, per
[`backgrounds/README.md`](backgrounds/README.md)); note that file's baked grain is a bg-light
property and does not carry over. The light one, "one prompt / i didn't
touch it" ([`reference/punch-cut-text-light.html`](reference/punch-cut-text-light.html),
your-job, 2026-09-10), is **the bg-light TEXT punch-cut — emphasized text with light
visuals**: one centred line per spoken beat, each stamped on its word (surfaces rise, the
payoff line pops word by word), the emphasis word in Playfair italic at x-height parity in the red
accent with an underline drawn on under it, and the props kept light — a prompt chip with a
blinking caret, flat paper-cutout chips with a hard offset shadow (no glow on a light field). It is
the default full-screen for a payoff LINE. Anatomy of a full-screen (+ what bg-dark adds):

- **Background:** the locked field baked into the comp (gradient + vignette CSS),
  film grain added by the same ffmpeg post-pass as the background asset
  (`noise=c0s=7:c0f=t`, libx264 crf 14).
- **The glow pass a bg-dark full-screen carries (2026-08-31, level locked
  at subtle) — this is its recipe:** build the content into TWO synced layers — `#content` plus a `#bloom`
  clone — and give the clone `filter:brightness(1.45) contrast(1.12) blur(30px);
  mix-blend-mode:screen; opacity:0.26; pointer-events:none`. Bright elements bleed
  light into the dark field, and because both layers are animated by the same class
  selectors the glow is frame-exact with every move. Populate both layers in JS
  (`cloneNode` into each) rather than duplicating markup by hand. 0.26 is the locked
  level — 0.40 was built and passed on, 0.58 blows highlights toward white. bg-light
  gets NO glow (light bleeding needs a dark field to bleed into).
  **The overlay lane gets the same light from THE PROP GLOW** — accent furniture
  (bars, dots, chips, meters) blooms in its own colour; type is default-off, glowing only
  where the subject itself emits light (neon, an LED readout, a terminal accent). Spec +
  the `overflow:hidden` trap: `default-overlay-style.md` § THE PROP GLOW.
- **Hero visual front and center** — big (640px on the mascot), horizontally centered,
  face-height. The graphic's subject is THE thing; caption below it.
- **Hero glow** = blurred duplicates of the image behind the sharp copy (never
  drop-shadow): blur 90px @ 0.38 (scaled 1.06) + blur 34px @ 0.30.
- **Caption** under the hero: Helvetica Bold lowercase + Playfair Italic on the power
  word, x-height parity.
- **Annotation arrow** where it helps: tail starts AT the caption, draws up to the hero
  (draw-on spec in animations.md — tangent-computed head, never eyeballed).
- **Entrances follow the variation principle (vary by ROLE)** — here the hero, the arrow and
  the caption each do a different job, so each takes a different move: hero flicker-in, arrow
  draw-on, caption rise-in. Where a graphic has PEERS instead (steps in a flow, rows in a list),
  they share one entrance and only the odd element out contrasts. ⚠️ On a bg-DARK punch-cut the
  hero cannot flicker — that graphic renders 12 fps style, which drops the strobe (`pop` or
  `slam` instead; see 4c and [`animations.md`](animations.md) § No `flash` on a 12 fps graphic).
- 🔒 **Hold life = THE FLOAT — TWO presets, `subtle` and `medium` (2026-08-31;
  replaces the retired ±2° wiggle). ZERO rotation.** A slow x/y drift with x and y on
  DIFFERENT periods, so the path traces a shallow ellipse instead of a straight diagonal —
  that period mismatch is what reads as floating rather than sliding. The element **rests at
  its authored position and drifts out and back (0 → A → 0)**; it never straddles it.

  🔒 **The float spans the element's ENTIRE on-screen life — entrance and exit compose ON TOP
  of it (2026-08-31).** It does not wait for the entrance to finish and then begin:
  the mascot floats *through* its flicker-in, the g6 hero floats *while* it rises. A graphic
  that holds still and then starts moving reads as two separate animations bolted together.
  In practice: `float(target, 0, DUR, preset)` — the whole composition, every time. Drift
  while the element is still invisible costs nothing and means it is already alive the
  instant it appears.

  | Preset | Travel | Periods | Max step @29.97 | Use on |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | **`subtle`** | 6px x · 8px y | 1.25s · 0.95s | 0.25 · 0.44 px/f | a WHOLE graphic — a card, a chat thread, a panel and its furniture |
  | **`medium`** | 10px x · 16px y | 1.35s · 1.05s | 0.39 · 0.80 px/f | ONE big hero element — the mascot, a hero card, a single node |

  **Which one is decided by what is moving, not by how big the frame is.** A whole graphic
  drifting reads as the panel being alive; the same amount on a lone hero reads as dead.
  Medium is derived from the mascot in the `edited` punch-cut, the reference implementation
  shipped in this preset: [`reference/punch-cut-reference.html`](reference/punch-cut-reference.html).

  **Values are TRAVEL in px, and neither preset scales with element size.** Two presets with
  fixed numbers is the whole point — "scale amplitude with element size" is what let graphics
  drift off the standard one at a time.

  ```js
  const FLOAT = {subtle: [6, 8, 1.25, 0.95], medium: [10, 16, 1.35, 1.05]};
  const float = (target, t0, t1, preset) => {
    const [AX, AY, PX, PY] = FLOAT[preset];
    const leg = (prop, A, p) => {
      let cur = 0, out = true;
      for (let t = t0; t < t1 - 0.02; t += p) {
        const rem = Math.min(p, t1 - t);
        cur += ((out ? A : 0) - cur) * (rem / p);   // partial last leg, SAME speed
        tl.to(target, {[prop]: cur, duration: rem, ease: 'sine.inOut'}, t);
        out = !out;
      }
    };
    leg('x', AX, PX); leg('y', -AY, PY);   // y drifts UP first
  };
  float('#floatWrap', t0, t1, 'subtle');
  ```

  ⚠️ **Specify TRAVEL, never amplitude.** That ambiguity shipped one pass at double intensity:
  `±10` reads as "amplitude 10" but the element moves 20.

  ⚠️ **Never let the final leg be truncated.** Giving it a short duration but the full travel
  makes the graphic cover its whole excursion in a fraction of the time, so the float visibly
  ACCELERATES into the exit — measured 0.82 px/frame in the last 0.4s against 0.44 everywhere
  else, which reads as the graphic getting agitated right before it leaves. Scale the last
  leg's travel by the time remaining (above) so the speed stays flat.

  ⚠️ **Measure at the TIMELINE rate.** A 12 fps-style render steps 2.5× further per rendered
  frame by definition; probing at the animation rate will make you "correct" a float that is
  already right.

  **A hold shorter than one period gets a partial leg, and that is correct** — g6's hero and
  g14's node both hold ~0.92s, so on `medium` they trace ~14px of y instead of 16. If a
  graphic needs more life, give it a longer hold, never a hotter float.

  ⚠️ **Which is why the float ALWAYS goes on a WRAPPER — no exceptions.** Once it runs the
  whole composition it necessarily overlaps the entrance and the exit, so any x/y they touch
  would fight it (GSAP gives the property to whichever tween was added last, silently). The
  wrapper is `position:absolute; inset:0`, so the child's own `left`/`top` still resolve
  against the full frame once the transform makes the wrapper a containing block; the child
  keeps the entrance, the exit, opacity, className, everything. Where the layers are
  hand-duplicated for the glow pass (`#content` + `#bloom`), the wrapper goes in BOTH; where
  the clone is built in JS from `innerHTML`, one edit covers both.

  Author it as explicit alternating tweens — never `repeat: -1`, which makes the timeline
  duration infinite and breaks the paused-seek render.

  On your-job: `subtle` on `g7` and `g12`, `medium` on `g6-wall`'s hero,
  `g14-flow`'s node and the `edited` mascot — all five on a wrapper, all five spanning
  `0 → DUR`.
- 🔒 **THE RACK FOCUS — a law, not an option (2026-09-10; first shipped on the g6 wall
  2026-08-31).** *"As soon as the text comes up, we need to rack the focus and darken the
  background so that we can clearly read the text."* Whenever TYPE lands over a scene — a wall,
  an artifact, a diagram, anything busier than the bare field — the scene racks OUT under it:
  blurred and darkened, everything including its own annotations, so the words alone are sharp.
  The recipe is a CLONE, never a filter tween (the `filter` tween ban in `graphics-qa.py`
  stands; the g10 wall blinked to black on one): the scene lives in `#scene`, and `#racked` is
  the same template cloned in with `filter: blur(10px) brightness(0.35) saturate(0.85)` baked (plus a full-frame black scrim at 0.62 inside the clone, so the field darkens with the scene) in
  its CSS and `opacity: 0`; the rack is `tl.to('#racked', {opacity: 1, duration: 10 * F})`
  starting on the type's own entrance (a background state change rides the move that motivates
  it; at 12 fps that is three stepped states, which reads as a rack, not a switch). Both layers
  are animated by the same class selectors, so the racked copy is frame-exact with the sharp
  one; the type sits in its own layer ABOVE `#racked`. **`#racked` lives at FRAME level — a sibling
  of the scaled `#content`, never inside it — with the scrim at `inset:-60px` and its own
  `.inner{transform:scale(0.92)}` wrapper holding the clone:** a racked layer inside the 0.92
  content box stops 4 % short of every edge and leaves a bright, sharp border around the darkened
  scene (g10 and g22 shipped that way for an hour, 2026-09-10: *"that shouldn't even have to hit
  the QA"*). `graphics-qa.py`'s `rack` check now fails a full-screen whose centre darkens while its
  edges do not. Traps that stay: the racked layer is `position:absolute; inset:0` (filter makes it
  a containing block), and the scrim's bleed past the frame is what keeps the blur from rimming it.
  The hero-entrance form (the hero **`slideIn('bottom')`** — off screen, so a SLIDE, 0.75s
  power2.out, ~0.45s before its word — while the scene racks over the same window) is one
  use of it; type over a scene is the other, and the mandatory one.

- 🔒 **A FULL-SCREEN IS A SCENE, NOT A CARD (2026-09-10).** *"We need more moving
  parts, more visuals, and more visually stimulating stuff … maybe we slide up to a scene, and
  then that scene slides completely out to the right, and something slides in from the left to a
  different scene. There's camera movement, there are different items and different pictures
  going in and out."* The bar every punch-cut clears, and the plan cell states each before a comp
  is built (`validate-plan.py` fails a punch-cut cell without them; `graphics-qa.py`'s `dynamics`
  check measures the render):
  ⚠️ **your examples are illustrations, never the spec (2026-09-10):** *"when I'm giving you
  editing advice, that's more of a 'for example' type thing … I took that so literally."* The
  slides, the camera, the scene changes below are WAYS a full-screen gets more going on; the
  brief is "more dynamic, more stuff happening," and the right way is whatever the beat calls
  for. Read every example he gives for the principle behind it, then design to the principle.
  1. **Phases — at least two.** Two visual beats that change what is on screen: a scene arriving
     and leaving, a rack focus, a reveal, a prop or picture coming in, a prop changing state. A
     single layout that only accretes elements is one phase. The cell lists them:
     `"phases": [{"at": 0, "what": "…"}, …]`.
  2. **Visuals — at least one that is not type.** A picture, an artifact, a prop, a diagram, a UI.
     Words on a field are a text animation, not a full-screen ("really just the text, kind of
     boring": g22 as first built). The cell lists them: `"visuals": ["…"]`.
  3. **Camera.** The scene wrapper moves over the span — the registry's `camera()` (a slow push
     1.00 → 1.05, or a pan) on top of THE FLOAT, so the composition is never a locked-off frame.
  4. **Transitions between phases** are one way to make a phase — a scene change from the
     registry's off-screen family, a rack focus handing the frame to the type, a prop changing
     state in place, a reveal — not a quota of slides. When scenes DO slide, **THE FLOW READS
     RIGHTWARD (2026-09-10):** the outgoing scene `slideOut('left')` as the incoming
     `slideIn('right')`, and the elements inside a scene arrive left to right — one direction the
     whole way. Never a scene that leaves right while the next scene's elements build left to
     right: *"← then → looks bad; it should look like → then →."*
  5. **Annotations are thesis statements, and they are DRAWN over the thing, never a chip on
     top of it.** A strike, a circle, an arrow over a scene draws at the START of its phase, as
     the point of showing the scene — never mid-graphic, where it reads as an accent to whatever
     word is being spoken. A word's accent belongs to the word (its slam, its underline, its
     colour). Crossing a prop out is a marker X drawn across it with the prop still visible; a
     red chip stamped over it hides the very thing being crossed out (g22's first build: *"it
     really gets covered by the X, the icon looks like nothing, random and ambiguous"*). One
     prop says one thing: "work" is a cog, "tune-ups" is a wrench — the literal, obvious icon,
     not a cluster.
  6. **Reuse keeps the field.** A scene brought back from an earlier full-screen (the thumbnail
     wall in g10 after g6) returns on the same background and at the same rate, then does
     something new to it (racks out under type, gets struck, slides away).
  Earned on your-job (2026-09-10): g10 put type over an un-racked wall with a strike
  timed to a word ("the strikethrough seems like an accent to autonomy but then it's also striking
  out the other people"), g16 was three nodes on a field ("super bare-bones, plain Jane"), g22 was
  four lines of type ("no visual elements"). All three were rebuilt to this bar.

**Timing craft:** cut TO the graphic a hair before the trigger word lands (~30ms early;
the word's own 80ms-led caption pops right after the cut). Cut BACK just before the next
spoken beat you want on camera. Trigger word "edited" at 2.067 → cut at 2.035; cut back
at 6.306 with "fully" at 6.436.

### 3. Scene slide — second beat inside a graphic
When the spoken content moves while the graphic holds, don't cut — **slide**: current
content group `slideOut('left')` as the next `slideIn('right')`, over the STATIC background
(the field never moves). The numbers are the registry's, not bespoke: **out 0.38s
`power3.inOut`, in 0.75s `power2.out`** ([`animations.md`](animations.md) slide family — the
in-slide must NOT take a power3 ease; measured, it dumps half the travel into step one). Text
on the incoming panel rides in pre-set; later words appear word-synced after it lands.

### 4a. Vector props (self-made VFX)
Literal-word moments (shot/break/boom) get **self-generated vector art in the comp** —
NEVER YouTube green-screen pulls (2026-08-29 lock: stock quality is a lottery and
choosing clips is a human call; if real footage is truly needed, flag it for your
manual pass). The shipped bullet holes: irregular dark core polygon + thin radiating
crack triangles (solid fills — [`default-overlay-style.md`](default-overlay-style.md)
§ PROPS ARE SOLID FILL), three distinct shapes, varied
rotation/scale. **Entrance = the house pop (see below).** Stagger multiple hits a few frames apart
(4.85 / 5.03 / 5.16 against "shot" at 4.773). SFX sells these later at the SFX step.

### 4b. THE SCALE ENTRANCES + motion blur (2026-08-31)
**Free-standing OBJECTS scale in** — a prop, a chip, an icon, the mascot, a flow node — using one
of two saved shapes. **Type, cards and panels RISE instead** (`riseIn`; see
[`animations.md`](animations.md) § The default entrance and exit). Full spec, knobs and the
render recipe:
[`text-animation/text-animation-style.md`](text-animation/text-animation-style.md).

The two shapes are `pop` (the default object entrance) and `slam` (the occasional heavier stamp,
for a punchline like the shipped "one shot." card). Their numbers are the registry's:
[`animations.md`](animations.md) § The presets.

🔒 **Motion blur is ON for slides and large movements (2026-09-10; reverses the
2026-08-31 "adds too much complexity" call: *"it really helps when we do the slides and large
movements"*).** Two halves, both needed, neither on a 12 fps graphic (4c stands — that look steps; you watched g16 with blur on the stepped frames on 2026-09-10 and undid it):
1. **THE SMEAR, in the registry.** Every `slideIn` / `slideOut` carries an SVG `feGaussianBlur`
   along its axis whose sigma follows the slide's velocity (`REG.smear.k` × the peak px per frame,
   capped at `REG.smear.max`: a frame-wide slide-in reads 34 px at its start and decays to 0 as it
   lands); every `pop` / `slam` carries a small isotropic one (`REG.smear.scale`, 6 px) that decays
   over the move. Tweened as an SVG attribute, never a CSS filter string; off under `stepFps`.
2. **The supersample, in the renderer:** `MBLUR=1 MBLUR_SS=8 MBLUR_SHUTTER=5 ./render.sh <id>` —
   8x is the ceiling (hyperframes refuses a frame rate over 240), a 225° shutter. On its own it
   leaves ghost copies 16 px apart at 4K on a frame-wide slide (measured on g22: 5x showed three
   copies, 8x five); with THE SMEAR under it the copies blend into a true smear.
   Use it on any timeline-rate comp that slides, moves its camera or pops something large; a
   comp of rises alone renders without it. Cost: 8x the frames (g22, 4.6 s at 4K: 48 s instead of 10).

**Scale `MBLUR_SS` with the TRAVEL DISTANCE, not with taste.** The default 5
supersamples cover a small scale pop fine, but anything crossing a large part of
the frame renders as 3 discrete ghost copies instead of a smear — the samples are
simply too far apart (measured on a full-height card slide, 2026-08-31: `MBLUR_SS=15`
was the fix). Pair a raised SS with `MBLUR_SHUTTER` at roughly 180° of that sample
count (`SS=15` → `SHUTTER=7`); the 216° default gets mushy once travel is large.

### 4c. 12 fps style — stepped animation (2026-08-31)
**THE DEFAULT for full-screen graphics on a DARK background, and only those**
(2026-08-31). The stepped motion reads as motion graphics against the navy
field. Everything else runs at the timeline rate: bg-LIGHT full-screens, overlay
cards, stat callouts, and text animations on the A-roll. The scope pairs with the glow —
a bg-dark full-screen gets 12 fps + glow; a bg-light one gets neither.
`STEP_FPS=12 ./render.sh <id>` animates at 12 fps and holds each frame, then expands
back to the timeline rate by duplication — the on-2s / stop-motion look.

🔒 **No `flash` on a 12 fps graphic (2026-08-31)** — use `pop` or `slam`; the measurement
and the general 83 ms-step form live in [`animations.md`](animations.md) § No `flash` on a 12 fps
graphic. The working renderer ships in this preset: [`reference/fullscreen-render.sh`](reference/fullscreen-render.sh)
(copy into the job's `hf-graphics/gfx/`; the text-animation `render.sh` carries the same
flags for alpha overlays). It is NEVER combined
with `MBLUR` (4b, and the measurement below).
Grain is applied AFTER the expansion at full rate: grain is a camera artifact, not
animation, and stepping it reads as a compression bug.

**Do NOT combine 12 fps style with MBLUR.** An instant appearance (`opacity 0 -> 1`)
landing inside a shutter makes that frame average empty-plus-present, and at 12 fps
that partial-opacity frame is HELD for ~3 timeline frames — so every element reads as
FADING IN. Measured on the g6 wall: a card went 7.8 -> 18.9 (held 3 frames) -> 83.4
with blur, versus a clean 7.8 -> 83.2 without. Fixing it means snapping every
appearance to the step grid minus half a shutter, which is more machinery than the
look is worth. Render 12 fps style unblurred; the stepping already reads as motion.

**At 12 fps the EASE is the smoothness** — prefer `power2.out` at ~0.75s for big travels, and when
a stepped move looks wrong measure the per-step positions off the render before touching anything
else (the per-step measurement is in [`animations.md`](animations.md), under the slide family).

Two other things to watch: word-synced events quantize to the 12 fps grid (up to
~83 ms of shift, so re-check anything that must land exactly on a word), and the
expansion makes the output a few frames long — harmless, placement pins the out point.

### 4d. READABLE graphics — the HOLD is the deliverable (2026-08-31)

**When a graphic exists so the viewer can READ something — a prompt, a command, a code block, a
config, a quote, a DM, a list of specifics — the complete content must sit still for 2-3
seconds.** People pause and screenshot this kind of graphic. If the reveal is still running when
the clip cuts, they never get a frame worth pausing on.

**A written artifact — a prompt, a command, a config, a quote — is shown COMPLETE and verbatim
from its written source, full-screen for as long as the line explains it, with the highlight
moving to the clause being spoken (2026-09-12).** A paraphrase, an ellipsis or a summary
label is not the artifact.

*"If we're showing a prompt, we should probably have the full prompt on screen longer so the
viewer has time to screenshot it or pause and look at it... the typing animation probably needs
to be a lot faster or it needs to come in earlier."*

**So budget the slot backwards from the hold, not forwards from the reveal.** The hold is the
point; the type-on, draw-on or stagger is garnish, and it gets whatever time is left:

```
reveal_end = clip_duration − HOLD        (HOLD = 2.5s for anything text-heavy)
```

g19 is the worked example. In a 4.50s slot it typed a 316-character prompt until 3.90 and held
the complete text for **0.60s** — unreadable, and unpausable in practice. Retimed to type
0.25 → 2.00, it now holds for **2.50s** in the identical slot: same graphic, same duration,
4× the readable time. Measured on the render by counting neutral-bright text pixels per frame
(exclude the accent cursor — its luma sits right at a naive threshold and the blink then makes
half the hold frames read as incomplete).

#### The reveal itself: BURSTS, never a linear wipe

**Revealing N characters every frame is a progress bar wearing a monospace font.** It has one
constant rate and no rhythm, and it reads as robotic however fast you run it. you: *"it just
looks a little stiff... split it up into chunks of words appearing at a time, that way it looks
more like mimicking real typing instead of just robotically revealing at a linear speed."*

Three things make it read as typing, and all three are cheap:

1. **Reveal by WORD BURST, not by character** — 2–6 words at a time.
2. **Hold each burst about a 12 fps beat** (~2 timeline frames at 29.97). The stepping is what
   kills the wipe feel; it does NOT require rendering the comp at 12 fps.
3. **Double the hold on a burst that ends in punctuation.** That hesitation is most of the
   realism — it is the only cue that says a mind is behind the keys.

**Everything must be DETERMINISTIC — never `Math.random`,** or the headless render seeks to
different text on every pass. And use a fixed irregular PATTERN rather than a modulo: `(i*5+2)%3`
looks varied and collapsed to 21 of 23 bursts being exactly 3 words, which is uniform in the one
dimension that matters. The pattern itself is a cycled list of burst sizes, and it ships as code —
`REG.burst` in [`reference/hf-anim.js`](reference/hf-anim.js), which `reveal()` reads: call the
helper rather than retyping an array, and change `REG.burst` if the cadence ever moves.

Measured on g19's render: **25 discrete steps held 1–4 frames each**, the 4s being the
punctuation pauses, against a new state every single frame before.

🔒 **PIN THE ZERO FRAME, or the reveal opens half-done.** A positioned `tl.set(el, {innerText})`
does not reliably revert when the renderer seeks back to the start — GSAP records whatever was
last applied as the "from" value — so g19 shipped a pass whose frame 0 already read
*"All right, go"*. `tl.set(el, {innerText: ''}, 0)` fixes it. This is the same law as every
element starting at CSS `opacity:0`: **never rely on the DOM's initial value surviving a seek,
state the zero frame explicitly.** It applies to any content-mutating reveal — text, counters,
list rows, a progress label.

Practical notes:

- **A faster type-on does not look wrong.** g19 already ran at ~89 chars/sec, far past human
  typing; at ~180 it reads as a fast paste or a stream, which is what an agent doing the typing
  should look like anyway.
- **Starting earlier is the cheaper lever.** The reveal can begin during the entrance — g19 starts
  typing at 0.25 while the terminal is still rising, and the two do not fight because the rise is
  nearly settled by then.
- **A blinking cursor keeps a static hold alive.** Solid while typing (a real terminal does not
  blink mid-keystroke), then a steady 0.30s blink through the hold.
- **If the content genuinely cannot be read in the slot, say so at plan time** — the fix is a
  longer clip or less text on screen, and both are the creator's call. Do not silently shrink the
  hold to fit the animation.

### 5. Emphasis push-in + text animation (A-roll emphasis)
When you vocally emphasize a phrase on camera, the footage pushes in on him. It is the
A-roll counterpart to move 1: **always paired with a text animation of the phrase**, so the
delivery, the picture and the type land on the same word. Reach for it wherever the read leans
on a phrase — it needs no instruction — and never as decoration on a flat line.

Numbers and the verify: [README § Emphasis push-in](README.md#emphasis-push-in--the-default-zoom-in-2026-08-31).

### 6. Opening zoom-out
Every video's first clip: 115 → 100 over 18 frames, quart (1 − (1 − t)⁴) — already locked in the
README. Don't ask, just bake it.

### 7. Real artifacts beat drawn ones (2026-08-30)
When the script points at something that **actually exists and is findable** — other
people's videos, a tweet, a repo, a product page, a comment — go get the real thing.
A drawn stand-in for a real artifact (a vector "video card" with a play triangle where
a thumbnail belongs, fake title bars, a made-up duration) reads as placeholder even
when it's well drawn. This is the counterpart to move 4a, not a contradiction: **invent
vector art for abstract/literal-word VFX, fetch the real asset for real things.**

- **YouTube thumbnails:** `yt-dlp "ytsearch12:<topic>" --skip-download --flat-playlist
  --print "%(id)s | %(view_count)s | %(channel)s | %(title)s"` to find them, then
  `https://i.ytimg.com/vi/<id>/maxresdefault.jpg` (fall back to `hqdefault.jpg`).
  Real durations via `yt-dlp --skip-download --print "%(duration_string)s"`. Store under
  the job's `assets/thumbs/<videoId>.jpg` and hardcode id + duration in the comp so the
  render stays deterministic.
- **Pick for VISUAL variety, not just relevance.** Any hot topic has thumbnail clone
  clusters (the your-job wall's first pass had three identical "CLAUDE + VIDEO"
  layouts and two identical "Claude Video Is Insane" layouts). Two near-identical
  thumbnails on one wall read as a rendering bug. Build a contact sheet, look at it,
  then swap duplicates for alternates. Spread light/dark/warm/cool and faces/non-faces.
- **Put one of your own in** when he's genuinely part of the set — a quiet easter egg,
  never the hero.
- **Layout note:** real thumbnails carry their own baked-in text, so don't add title
  lines under them — that's two layers of type fighting. A thin frame + the real
  duration chip is enough to read as "video". And when a card bleeds off the right
  frame edge, flip its chip to the card's left, or it renders visibly clipped.
- **CSS trap:** the thumbnail rule (`height:100%; object-fit:cover`) will also match
  any hero/mascot image sharing the class — an override must reset `height` AND
  `object-fit`, not just width, or the hero gets silently cover-cropped at the sides
  (this clipped the mascot's edge nubs once before it was caught).

## Rhythm — the retention law (2026-08-29)

### 🔒 THE DENSITY NUMBERS — measured off the shipped intro (2026-08-31)

The rhythm law gives a FLOOR ("something every ~10s") and the scope contract gives a card
CEILING, but nothing told you the actual cadence — so a conformant plan could ship at half the
reference density and still pass every rule. These are the shipped `your-job` intro's
real numbers. **Plan to them, per MINUTE of runtime** (the old "per section" scoping is
meaningless on a single continuous raw, which is one section by definition):

| per minute of finished runtime | target | shipped intro (121.0s, 25 graphics) |
|---|---|---|
| **graphic events, all kinds** | **11–13** | 25 events = **12.4/min** |
| of which **text animations** | 6–7 | 13 = 6.4/min |
| of which **full-screen graphics** | 2–3 | 5 = 2.5/min |
| of which **scenes** (the enacting kind) | ~1 | 2 = 1.0/min |
| of which **cards / stat callouts / annotations** | 2–3 | 5 = 2.5/min |
| **emphasis push-ins** (on V1) | **2–3**, spread | 4 = 2.0/min (2026-09-10: "a couple more … a little bit more camera movement, at points that need it, don't overdo it": your-job went from 3 to 6 over 2:16, none closer than 7 s, no 30 s stretch without one) |
| **longest bare stretch** | **≤ 6s** | 5.44s |
| **decorative full-screen share of runtime** | **≤ 25%** (required demonstrations tracked separately) | 21.4s = 17.7% |

Read that as a cadence, not a quota: the beats still decide WHICH graphic goes where, and a
stretch with nothing to show stays bare. But a plan landing at 5 events/minute is not "restrained",
it is under the reference look, and a plan at 20 is over it.

**SPREAD, not just count (2026-09-10).** The full-screens are spaced across the whole
runtime: **never more than 40 s of runtime without one** (the first inside the first 40 s, the last
inside the last 40 s, no gap over 40 s between two). your-job shipped 3 full-screens in
its first 41 s and none in the remaining 95 s, passed every number above, and read front-loaded;
the fix was two more (a flow beat at 71 s, a text beat at 102 s) and this rule. A beat that carries
a payoff LINE gets the bg-light TEXT punch-cut (move 2, second reference); one that carries an
artifact or a process gets the dark one. `validate-plan.py` and `graphics-qa.py` warn on a gap over
40 s and on fewer than 2 full-screens per minute.

Apply this through the final kept sentence, including restored or added footage. Review dark
scene coverage across the opening, middle and closing beats; several light capture scenes or one
long prompt walkthrough do not replace the dark scene vocabulary elsewhere.

**The field (2026-09-10): bg-dark by default, bg-light as the accent.** *"I think the dark
background we should use as the default for most graphics. The light background should really
only be an accent one that we use if it calls for it."* Reach for the light field when the visual
reads better on it — dark ink and paper-cutout props, a real artifact shot on white, the thumbnail
wall — not on a rotation (the 2026-08-31 strict alternation is retired; two darks in a row are
fine). The choice still drives locked render flags
([`backgrounds/README.md`](backgrounds/README.md)). Pick by what the visual
reads better on (dark field for bright/glowy/UI-style art, light field for dark ink and props).


- **Something visual happens at least every ~10 seconds** — more when it flows. No stretch
  of nothing, ever; rhythm beats perfection.
- **A visual-content stretch gets continuous coverage**: when the script is describing
  something visual, graphics run for its WHOLE length — 30 seconds of visual storytelling
  means 30 straight seconds of visuals telling it.
- **The ladder:** beat clearly visual → a visual move (punch cut, chart, prop, card).
  Nothing obvious → a text animation. Never bare.

## Variety — the anti-stale law (2026-08-29)

Variety IS retention: new things keep happening, so it never feels flat.

- **Text animations are EXEMPT from this law** — they are the connective tissue that carries the
  density floor and legitimately run back to back (the shipped intro does). For the big moves:
  **never the same FULL-SCREEN treatment or card template twice in a row.** Rotate moves, rotate entrances (the
  variation principle), rotate looks.
- **Word-level treatments inside pops**, when the content calls for one: a **red
  highlight** sweeping a negation word ("that's *not* it" → `#ff4d5e` family); an
  **inline mini data-viz** behind a quantity word ("100% into discipline, 20% into
  structure" → a bar fills behind each word to its number); an underline; the emphasis
  font. When nothing calls for one, a plain pop is right — don't force it.
- **The field is NOT a variety axis** — `bg-dark` is the default, `bg-light` the accent; see
  § THE DENSITY NUMBERS, The field.

## Placement mechanics (how these reach the timeline)

**Universal:** graphics render as **mp4** (full-screen, grain baked) or **ProRes 4444
straight-alpha mov** (overlays), then land on the graphics track at the plan's times. Two rules
hold in every app:

- **Every full-screen graphic gets the film-grain pass** — the standing recipe, same as
  bg-light's: `ffmpeg -vf "noise=c0s=7:c0f=t" -c:v libx264 -crf 14 -pix_fmt yuv420p` on
  the comp render before import. Alpha overlays ship clean.
- **Verify composites from the app's own program output**, never from the comp render — the
  composite over real footage is what the viewer sees.

- **A re-render is a NEW filename**, never an overwrite of a placed file: every editing app
  caches something about a placed path, and the failure is silent on all of them.
- **After any placement, read the track back** (start/end per clip) before trusting it.

**Which track, which command, and which alpha convention each app wants is the app skill's,
not this preset's: [`LANES.md`](../../../LANES.md) § step 5** points at the recipe per lane
(`premiere-pro`, `davinci-resolve`, `capcut`). On any app without one, drag the movs onto an
overlay track above the grade at the printed times; nothing above is required to get the look,
only to script it.
