# TikTok/Raw Style — your LOCKED preset (hook card + line captions)

The standard graphics + caption treatment for **short-form TikTok/raw talking-head** videos
(the "front hook card only, then raw" format). Locked 2026-06-24 (`your-job`).
Apply verbatim every time.

Two overlays, dead simple, **no animation**:
1. **HOOK CARD** — one static white box / black text, pinned top, shown only over the spoken hook line.
2. **CAPTIONS** — line-by-line, parked low under the face, **always on** for the whole video.

Builder: [`presets/tiktok/raw/build.py`](build.py) · Corrections: [`transcript-corrections.json`](../../../transcript-corrections.json)

Engine = PIL PNG overlays + ffmpeg `overlay` (enable-timing). This ffmpeg has **no** `drawtext`/`libass`,
and PIL gives exact control over the Inter weight + stroke + box — it's the house pattern.

## 🔒 THE LOOK — locked

**Hook card** (top)
- **Font:** Inter **Bold** (`assets/fonts/Inter-Bold.otf`).
- **Size:** `64px`, black text `#000` on a solid **white** box `#fff`.
- **Box:** radius `22px`, sized to the **actual ink extents** (not font metrics) + padding `32px` x / `20px` y —
  it hugs the text, never balloons. Max width `940px`, centered. No animation — hard cut on/off.
- **Position:** box top at `y250` (just under the 200px top safe band).
- **When:** only over the spoken hook — auto-ends on the first sentence break, override with
  `--hook-end SECONDS`.
- **Copy:** styled, not necessarily verbatim. Lowercase-casual brand voice. Set with `--hook-text "..."`.

**Captions** (bottom)
- **Font:** Inter **Bold**.
- **Size:** `42px`. **Text:** white `#fff` with a `4px` **black stroke** (`stroke_fill`), **no box**.
- **Position:** horizontally centered, vertical center `y1500` — low, under the face, above the 300px bottom band.
- **Phrasing:** ~3–4 words per line (`MAX_WORDS=4` / `MAX_CHARS=20`), broken on clause/sentence punctuation.
- **Animation:** none. Each line is a hard cut and **holds until the next line begins** (no flicker, no gaps).
- **Always on:** captions run from the first word to the last, the whole video. The hook card just overlays
  on top during its window — it does NOT replace the captions underneath.

**Safe zones:** every key visual stays inside `y200 → y1620`. Hook card sits below 200; captions sit above 1620.

## 🔒 THE TIMING RULE — this is the lock

**Always build from the canonical transcribe-once transcript:** `projects/<job>/outputs/<job>.transcript.json`
(WhisperX large-v3 word timings remapped through `cuts.json` — the SAME timeline as the audio that ships, so
captions are on-beat with zero manual nudging). **Caption over the render that SHIPS** (the final cut). Never
re-transcribe; never time off an ad-hoc subset transcript.

## 🔧 AUTO-FIX mis-transcribed words

Every word runs through [`transcript-corrections.json`](../../../transcript-corrections.json) (`auto` map) — add your brand and product-name fixes there — before captioning (display text only; the source transcript is never touched). The builder also **drops
sub-0.2s single-word slivers** (clip-boundary false-start tails like a clipped "what?"). Grow the corrections
file whenever a new mistake shows up.

## ▶️ Per-job workflow (step 5: the hook card + the caption layer, on by default)

**Captions are a step-5 graphic (2026-09-04), not a pass.** With `--alpha` the builder emits
the ALPHA overlay that IS the step-5 output; the lane's placer lays it on the top graphics track like
any other graphic:

```bash
uv run presets/tiktok/raw/build.py projects/<job> --alpha --hook-text ""                                   # → projects/<job>/hf-graphics/captions/renders/captions-alpha.mov (captions only)
uv run presets/tiktok/raw/build.py projects/<job> --alpha --hook-only --hook-end <V1 cut> --hook-text "…" \
    --out projects/<job>/hf-graphics/gfx/renders/<hook-cell-id>-alpha.mov                                   # → the hook card as its OWN overlay
```

**Two layers, two clips (2026-09-08, `your-job`).** The plan carries the hook
card as its own cell and the captions as the `captions` cell, so the build emits them as two alpha
movs: the placer lays the hook on the graphics track and the captions on the top track, each a
trimmable clip. `--hook-end` takes the plan cell's end, which `validate-plan.py` has already pinned
ON the V1 cut. (One combined mov, the pre-2026-09-08 behaviour, is still what you get with
`--alpha --hook-text "…"` and no `--hook-only`; `clipper` uses the burn path.)

It needs no flat render (works at `RENDER=0`): duration comes from `transcript/cuts.json`, fps from
`raw/`, words from the canonical transcript. **The layout is authored at 1080×1920 and rendered at
the base's size:** `--scale` defaults to the raw's upright width over 1080 (a 4K rotated raw makes a
2160×3840 sequence, so the same look renders at 2×; every pixel figure above doubles on the frame).
Never scale the finished mov in the editor instead. The plan carries the `captions` cell
(`graphics-plan` § The captions cell); placing the layer is a lane mechanic —
[`LANES.md`](../../../LANES.md) § step 5 (Premiere: `lanes/premiere/place-graphics.py --plan --write`;
chat-only: one more overlay in the assemble). The flat burn below is the PREVIEW path (and what
`clipper` ships, because a clip has no timeline).

Preconditions: the rough cut + derived transcript exist (`outputs/<job>.mp4` + `outputs/<job>.transcript.json`).

1. **Preview** the first 30s while you dial the hook copy:
   `uv run presets/tiktok/raw/build.py projects/<job> --until 30 --hook-text "your hook"`
   → writes `/tmp/video-editor/<job>/tiktok-raw/preview.mp4` and prints the caption sheet + detected `hook_end`.
2. **Whole-video preview** — drop `--until` for a full burned look-check (still a preview: the
   deliverable is the alpha layer placed at step 5 and the lane's own render; only `clipper` ships a
   burned file, and `finalize.sh` owns `outputs/<job>.final.mp4`):
   `uv run presets/tiktok/raw/build.py projects/<job> --hook-text "your hook"`

On the burn path the rough cut at `outputs/<job>.mp4` stays the clean base the builder reads from
(don't overwrite it, or a re-run would caption an already-captioned video); on the alpha path there is
nothing to overwrite.

## Knobs (only if asked to tweak)

Captions: `CAP_SIZE` · `CAP_WEIGHT` (`Semibold`/`Regular`/…) · `CAP_STROKE` · `CAP_CENTER_Y` (height) ·
`CAP_MAX_WORDS`/`CAP_MAX_CHARS` (phrase length) · uppercase = map `.upper()` in `render_caption`.
Hook card: `--hook-text`, `--hook-end`, `HOOK_SIZE`/`HOOK_PAD_*`/`HOOK_RADIUS`/`HOOK_TOP_Y`/`HOOK_WEIGHT`.
