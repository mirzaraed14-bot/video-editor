#   Windows (native): supported — run from Git Bash (the shell Claude Code uses
#                     on Windows). Panel installs under %APPDATA%, CEP debug
#                     mode via the registry, bridge folder under %TEMP%.
#   Linux:            no Premiere exists; use the default chat-only pipeline.
#
# After it finishes: restart Premiere (the panel is patched to start the bridge
# itself; nothing to click), then restart Claude Code once so it picks up
# .mcp.json (answer YES when it asks to enable this project's MCP servers).
# Verify with: node lanes/premiere/premiere-bridge.mjs ping. Only if the
# autostart patch reported that it did not apply: Window > Extensions >
