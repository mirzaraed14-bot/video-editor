# 🛠️ Setup — read this first

This is a **video editing system you run with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code).** You
drop in raw footage, and Claude takes it from **raw → fully edited → exported.** It does short-form
explainers, TikTok/raw-style verticals, and long-form YouTube intros, with locked, on-brand captions,
graphics, colour and sound design.

**Runs natively on macOS, Windows, and Linux.** On a Mac it uses Apple's hardware video encoder; on
Windows/Linux it uses software encoding — same output, just a bit slower.

The fastest path: unzip, open this folder in Claude Code, and say **"run the setup"** (or "set me
up"). Claude detects your OS, runs the one-command auto-installer (**`./setup.sh`**: installs every
tool via Homebrew on macOS / winget on Windows, bootstraps the render engine, verifies itself,
**auto-detects your editing app** (Premiere Pro / DaVinci Resolve / CapCut) and wires its lane, and
is safe to re-run), and walks you through the one or two restarts along the way. If you have several
editing apps installed it asks one question: which one you edit in. That's the whole setup.
Personalizing the look/voice (your brand kit) is **optional** and can happen any time later, or
never. Everything below is the same setup by hand, if you prefer to see each step.

### 🪟 On Windows — one install first

No WSL, no virtual machine — the system runs natively. Its scripts run through **Git Bash**, the
Unix shell that ships with **Git for Windows** (it's also the shell Claude Code itself uses on
Windows), so that's the one thing to install first:

1. Install **Git for Windows**: `winget install Git.Git` (in PowerShell), then restart Claude Code
   so it finds Git Bash.
2. Unzip the project **outside Documents, Desktop, Pictures, Videos, Music and OneDrive**, e.g.
   `C:\Users\<you>\video-editor` (Windows Explorer's Extract All is fine), and open that folder in
   Claude Code. Those folders are guarded by Windows Security's Controlled Folder Access on many
   machines, which silently blocks Git Bash, node and python from writing there, and the error
   reads "No such file or directory", not "permission denied". `./setup.sh` checks for this first
   and says what to do.
3. That's it. Everything below runs unchanged; wherever a command says `brew`, use the
   **Windows (winget)** version below. After any `winget install`, open a **new** terminal
   (and restart Claude Code once) so PATH picks the tool up.

---

## 1. Install the prerequisites

**The automatic way** (recommended; auto-installs on macOS + Windows, prints the exact apt
commands on Linux and finishes the rest there too):

```bash
./setup.sh
```

It detects your OS, installs everything missing, bootstraps the render engine, verifies, then
auto-detects your editing app and wires its lane (one app: wired automatically; several: it asks
which you edit in). Re-run it after any restart: it skips what's done and finishes the rest. (The
one manual step it can ask of you: installing Homebrew itself on a fresh Mac, which needs your
password; after that it finds Homebrew and puts it on your PATH itself.) It tells you exactly when a
Claude Code restart is needed; at most two once setup starts (once when just-installed tools or
Homebrew's PATH need a fresh session, once after an editing-app MCP is wired), plus the one-off
Git for Windows restart above if you needed that. After the MCP restart, Claude Code asks whether
to enable this project's `.mcp.json` servers: answer yes. (Clicked no? That choice is remembered;
`claude mcp reset-project-choices` in a terminal clears it, then restart once more and answer yes.)

**The manual way** — run the report-only checker and follow what it prints:

```bash
./check-setup.sh
```

### Core (required — the raw → exported pipeline)

`./check-setup.sh` prints the right command for whichever OS you're on — run it and follow what it shows.

**macOS:**

```bash
# Homebrew (skip if you already have it)
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

brew install ffmpeg          # every audio/video pass (cut, captions, music, render)
brew install uv              # builds the WhisperX transcription engine on first run
brew install node            # the graphics render engine (npx hyperframes)
brew install python          # caption text overlays + the pipeline scripts
brew install pillow          # PIL — text overlays (this ffmpeg has no built-in text)
brew install yt-dlp          # optional: downloading reference clips + YouTube research
```

**Windows (winget — built into Windows 11 / App Installer):**

```bash
winget install Gyan.FFmpeg           # every audio/video pass (cut, captions, music, render)
winget install OpenJS.NodeJS.LTS     # the graphics render engine (npx hyperframes)
winget install Python.Python.3.12    # caption text overlays + the pipeline scripts
winget install astral-sh.uv          # builds the WhisperX transcription engine on first run
python -m pip install pillow         # PIL — text overlays (run AFTER the Python install, new terminal)
winget install yt-dlp.yt-dlp         # optional: downloading reference clips + YouTube research
```

> Open a **new terminal** after the winget installs (and restart Claude Code once) so PATH updates.
> Note: on Windows, Python is `python`, not `python3` — the `python3` name there is a fake
> Microsoft Store stub. The pipeline scripts handle this automatically.

**Linux (Ubuntu / Debian):**

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y ffmpeg python3 python3-pip python3-pil   # video passes + caption text (PIL)

# Node ≥22 (the render engine) — Ubuntu's apt node is too old, so use NodeSource:
curl -fsSL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_22.x | sudo -E bash - && sudo apt install -y nodejs

# uv (builds the WhisperX transcription engine on first run):
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

sudo apt install -y wamerican   # optional: enables the transcript-QA word scan
uv tool install yt-dlp          # optional: reference clips + YouTube research (apt's build is too old for YouTube)
```

Then bootstrap the render engine **once**:

```bash
npx hyperframes@0.8.16 browser ensure   # downloads the headless browser the graphics renderer uses
```

> Pinned to `@0.8.16` — the version the locked caption/graphics presets were validated against.
> Using the same version for the one-time bootstrap means it's cached once and every render uses it.
> Its npm and telemetry notices are noise; ignore any "newer version available" line and never run
> `hyperframes upgrade`.
>
> **On Linux,** if the bootstrap (or a render) reports a missing shared library, install the headless-Chrome
> deps it names, e.g. `sudo apt install -y libnss3 libatk-bridge2.0-0 libgtk-3-0 libgbm1 libasound2t64`.

**First edit is slow, once.** The first time you run a job, the rough-cut step downloads the WhisperX
`large-v3` speech model (~3–5 GB) and builds its environment. That takes several minutes and needs
internet — but only the first time. Every job after is fast. **Your hardware is auto-detected:** an
NVIDIA GPU (Windows/Linux) transcribes on CUDA, several times faster than CPU (the first build adds
the ~3 GB CUDA stack), and if the GPU path ever fails it falls back to CPU automatically, so
transcription always works. The GPU build is verified, not assumed: the transcriber probes CUDA
after installing it and records what actually works, and if it ever has to fall back it prints a
loud SLOW PATH banner rather than quietly taking several times longer. Macs and GPU-less machines
run the reliable CPU path. **If that first build
is interrupted** (a closed laptop, a dropped connection), nothing is left half-broken: the transcriber
records a `.deps-ok` sentinel only once the environment is complete, so on the next run it sees the
incomplete state, wipes `~/.cache/video-editor/whisperx-venv` and rebuilds cleanly. (Same idea, much smaller: the face-framing
tool `workflows/face-frame.py` auto-installs its OpenCV dependency via `uv` on first use, ~50 MB.)

### Fonts — all bundled, nothing to install

- **Inter** — bundled in `assets/fonts/` (free, Open Font License). The display font for signature-style
  and long-form graphics. Nothing to install — and it's the cross-platform default. *(macOS only:
  prefer Apple's SF Pro?* Install the free "San Francisco Pro" pack from <https://developer.apple.com/fonts>
  and set it in `brand-kit.md`. On Windows/Linux, stay on the bundled Inter.)
- **Coolvetica** — bundled in `assets/fonts/` (the locked explainer caption look). Nothing to do.
- **SF Pro (system)** — *optional.* The TikTok/raw overlays render from bundled **Inter** by default; SF Pro is not required.

### Optional (only if you use the feature)

- **Premiere lane** (the recommended finish if you edit in Premiere — the rough cut
  lands on your timeline as **separate, trimmable clips**, and Claude can build graphics, apply
  effects, recolor sections, and run the final export in there too): one command,
  ```bash
  ./setup-premiere.sh
  ```
  It installs the pinned Premiere MCP engine (`vendor/premiere-mcp`, built from source at a verified
  commit), installs the **MCP Bridge (CEP)** panel into Premiere, and writes `.mcp.json`. Safe to
  re-run; it skips what's already done. Requires **Adobe Premiere Pro** (validated on Premiere Pro 2026, 26.x) on
  **macOS or Windows** — plain Linux has no Premiere, use the default chat-only pipeline.
  Afterward: restart Premiere (setup patches the panel to start the bridge itself, so there is
  nothing to click) → restart Claude Code once (answer yes when it asks to enable this project's
  `.mcp.json` servers) → verify with `node lanes/premiere/premiere-bridge.mjs ping`.
- **DaVinci Resolve lane** (the same finish, in Resolve on macOS, Windows, or Linux; Studio and
  the free edition both work): one command,
  ```bash
  ./setup-resolve.sh
  ```
  It installs the pinned Resolve MCP server (`vendor/davinci-resolve-mcp`, built from source at a
  verified commit), detects your edition, and writes the `davinci-resolve` entry into `.mcp.json`
  (other servers are left untouched). Safe to re-run. **Studio:** the MCP talks to Resolve's
  scripting API directly; Resolve just has to be running (Claude can launch it), and there's
  nothing to change inside it: **External scripting = Local is its default** (only if the
  connection fails, check **Preferences → System → General → External scripting = Local**).
  **Free edition:** Blackmagic gates external scripting to Studio, so setup installs the MCP's
  in-app bridge into Resolve's Scripts menu and enables it. One recurring step, every time you
  start Resolve: open a project, then **Workspace → Scripts → resolve_bridge**, and leave it
  running. (Detected the wrong edition? `./setup-resolve.sh --studio` or `--free`.) Afterward:
  restart Claude Code once (answer yes when it asks to enable this project's `.mcp.json` servers)
  → verify by asking Claude to get the Resolve version. The `davinci-resolve` skill documents
  everything the lane can do, plus the API calls to avoid.
- **CapCut lane** (the same, in the CapCut desktop app — macOS only): nothing to
  install beyond CapCut itself. `uv run lanes/capcut/capcut-bridge.py replay <job>` writes the rough cut
  as a native CapCut draft, one trimmable clip per cut. **Quit CapCut fully before running it** (it
  clobbers new drafts on exit otherwise). Full lane rules + live-editing commands: the CapCut section
  in `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Speaker labels** (`rough-cut --diarize`): set `HUGGINGFACE_TOKEN` (see `.env.example`). The normal
  single-speaker flow does **not** need this.
- **yt-dlp** (downloading reference clips and YouTube research for graphics): nothing in the pipeline
  calls it, it's a hand tool. `./setup.sh` installs it for you on macOS and Windows; on Linux run
  `uv tool install yt-dlp` (apt's build is too old for YouTube). Clips headed into Premiere must be
  H.264 (the format string is in `lanes/premiere/lab-notes.md`).

---

## 2. Make it yours (optional: any time, or never)

The editor works out of the box with a neutral bundled look (Inter fonts, a generic starter
palette). Personalization only makes captions and graphics sound and look like *you*.
Whenever you want that:

1. **Fill in `brand-kit.md`** — your name, niche, handles, voice/tone, brand colors, fonts, hook style,
   and brand wordlist. This is the one file that drives how every caption and graphic sounds and looks.
   (Part A is the fill-in form; **Part B** spells out exactly which file and token each value changes, if
   you want to do it by hand or verify Claude's work.)
2. *(Optional)* **Add your logos** to `assets/logos/` — any brand marks you want available for graphics.

Then tell Claude **"apply my brand kit"** and it writes those values into the presets and `CLAUDE.md`
for you (the exact map is Part B of `brand-kit.md`), and renders a quick test so you can see the look
took.

---

## 3. Edit your first video

1. Put a raw clip somewhere handy (e.g. `~/Downloads`).
2. In Claude Code, say: **"edit this video: ~/Downloads/yourclip.mp4"**.
3. Claude copies it into `projects/<job>/raw/`, runs the rough cut, plans graphics, and walks the rest
   of the pipeline with you. It auto-detects the format from the footage (vertical = short-form,
   horizontal = long-form YouTube) and states the hook + takeaway it read from your transcript;
   correct it in a word if it read wrong.
4. The finished deliverable is `projects/<job>/outputs/<job>.final.mp4` (promoted by `./finalize.sh
   <job> --apply`, which also drops an export copy in `~/Downloads/`, ready to upload).

That's it. The whole pipeline and how each step works is documented in `CLAUDE.md`.

## What's in the box

| Path | What it is |
|------|-----------|
| `CLAUDE.md` | The editor's brain — the pipeline, the rules, the format variants. |
| `brand-kit.md` | Optional personalization: fill it in whenever you want the output to carry your brand. |
| `setup.sh` | One-command auto-setup: detects macOS/Windows, installs everything, bootstraps the renderer, wires your editing app's lane. |
| `check-setup.sh` | Prerequisite checker (report-only). |
| `.claude/skills/` | The editing skills + the HyperFrames render toolkit. |
| `presets/` | The locked looks, one folder per preset — **`youtube/default/` (THE long-form default: the overlay cards + the creative-moves vocabulary)**, signature style, captions, TikTok/raw, liquid-glass, the vox print-collage long-form look (which carries `motion-craft.md`, its own craft rules — vox-only, never the default). |
| `workflows/` | Universal utilities (`voice-gain.py` for step 3, `sfx-plan.py` for step 6, face framing, chin line, the graphics QA gate, hand tracking, window capture and recording). Nothing app-specific. |
| `lanes/` | Everything app-specific, one folder per editing app: `premiere/` (bridge, launch, grade, placement scripts + templates), `resolve/` (`resolve-templates/` fps-matched project templates, `resolve-grading/` the color playbook, `resolve-export.md` delivery-render settings, `resolve-audio-polish/` the final audio pass), `capcut/` (the bridge + schema templates), `chat-only/` (the ffmpeg assemble sheet). Each carries a `lab-notes.md` with that app's own gotchas. `LANES.md` at the root says, per pipeline step, which app has a scripted recipe and where it lives. |
| `assets/` | Fonts (bundled) + the face-detection model + `luts/` (30 cubes, with the house **Autumn-Rec709** look captured and ready so step 4 grades itself) + `sfx/` (the full SFX library the presets were tuned on, 151 clips, so step 6 runs with nothing else to download) + `logos/` for your own brand marks (you supply). |
| `projects/` | Your job folders land here (one per video). |
| `finalize.sh` | The export step — promotes the final render to `outputs/<job>.final.mp4` and copies it to `~/Downloads/` (dry-run by default). |
| `prune.sh` | Reclaims disk space from old render scratch (dry-run by default). |
