"""audio-qa.py <job_dir> — post-splice audio self-check (advisory, never fails the build).

Scans the freshly spliced output for the two artifact classes that have actually shipped:
  1. JOINT CLICKS — step discontinuities at segment butt-joins. The splice applies 5 ms
     edge declick fades, so any joint that still spikes means a regression (or a source
     transient landing exactly on a boundary — inspect by ear).
  2. LIMITER PRESSURE — how hard the -6 dBFS brickwall is working. A static gain that
     drives sustained speech into the ceiling ducks the surrounding audio (5 ms attack /
     50 ms release) — audible as tiny "swallows" on stressed words. If pressure is high,
     the gain came from voice-gain.py's -17 LUFS target, which deliberately runs the
     limiter hard (2026-09-03); only act on this if it is audible, with AMPLIFY_DB
     two under the measured number, and compare by ear.

Stdlib only (no numpy). Reads outputs/<job>.mp4 + transcript/cuts.json.
