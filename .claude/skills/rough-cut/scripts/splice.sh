# SINGLE-PASS CLEAN SPLICE — cut + concat happen in ONE ffmpeg filtergraph, and the audio
# polish (static gain → hard limiter) is applied exactly ONCE to the assembled track, then
# encoded to AAC exactly ONCE. This is the "cut from raw, master once at the end" order:
#   • Audio rides through the cut LOSSLESS (PCM in the filtergraph) — NEVER encoded per-segment.
#     The old approach encoded each segment to AAC, copy-concatenated those AAC chunks (each join
#     splices in ~1024+ samples of AAC encoder priming = a tiny CLICK at every cut), then encoded
#     AAC a 2nd time. Two lossy generations + a click per boundary on pristine PCM source audio.
#     Processing per-segment before assembly is the bug; processing once after assembly is the fix.
#   • A/V stay LOCKED by construction: video and audio are trimmed from the SAME in/out points in
#     the same graph and concatenated together — no independent rebuild that could drift.
#   • trim/setpts rebases the first frame to pts 0 (no empty edit / QuickTime black-flash), verified.
#
# Audio chain — STATIC gain + hard limiter (your Premiere move). NOT loudnorm: single-pass
#   loudnorm runs DYNAMIC (rides gain over time) and PUMPS. This is static + transparent: constant
#   +AMPLIFY_DB gain, peaks brickwalled at −6 dBFS, zero time-varying leveling. Raw record level is
#   ~−30 dB mean, which is what the gain is calibrated against. `level=disabled` is REQUIRED —
#   alimiter's auto-level defaults ON and re-normalizes loud (clips to +TP / crushes LRA);
#   limit=0.501 = −6 dBFS. AMPLIFY_DB is the only loudness knob and, unset, it is MEASURED:
#   workflows/voice-gain.py puts the raw's kept speech at −17 LUFS integrated pre-limiter (locked
#   2026-09-03 off your-job, where +15 was perfect — you like the limiter working hard,
#   which reverses the 2026-06-28 "+15 too hard" call). Set AMPLIFY_DB to override.

# Joint treatment: J-CUT CROSSFADES, not fades-to-zero. A butt-splice clicks whenever a
# joint misses a zero crossing (measured 1-sample jumps up to ~80x local signal), but
# fading each edge down to silence trades the click for a ~20 ms ROOM-TONE HOLE at every
# joint — measured 8-13 dB ambience dips, still audible on headphones. The editorial fix:
# each segment's AUDIO runs XF seconds PAST its video cut (real continuing room tone from
# the raw) and equal-power crossfades into the next segment's head. Ambience never dips,
# a step discontinuity is impossible, and the chain arithmetic keeps timing exact:
# sum((dur_i + XF)) - (n-1)*XF == sum(dur_i) == video duration. The rising head gain also
# softens mouth/lip transients that sit a few ms after cut-ins (word starts run late vs
# acoustic onsets). This is part of the CUT (a DAW's auto-crossfade), NOT per-segment
# mastering — the gain->limiter->encode chain still runs exactly once on the whole track.
