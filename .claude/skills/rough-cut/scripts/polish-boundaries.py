"""polish-boundaries.py — uniform, peak-relative cut boundaries for every segment.

Built 2026-08-28 from the your-job session, where you heard exactly what the
old absolute-threshold measurement produces: some words clipped at the end, others with
too much room ("you're not even cutting right at the end of some words"). Hardened the
same day by an adversarial review (10 findings, all fixed here). Root causes covered:

  1. A threshold set from the noise floor alone falls below room tone on quiet setups,
     so a "decay" walks seconds into the gap and the clamp then cuts the word short.
  2. A soft voiced decay drops below an absolute threshold while still audible.
  3. A breath after a word gets counted as part of it (out lands late).
  4. Low-probability boundary words (p <= 0.35 clusters) mean the WhisperX TIMESTAMP IS
     FICTION, not just soft — real speech ran ~750 ms past the claimed end on a measured
     case ("...90% of the way th—"). That applies to the NEXT word too: a low-prob next
     word makes the search limit itself fiction, so the limit extends to the next
     TRUSTED word.
  5. refine-cuts.py classifies a dead-air kill between ADJACENT transcript words as a
     continuous split: it skips measuring those boundaries entirely.
  6. The two sides of a joint must be resolved as a PAIR (same invariant as refine's
     pass 3): independent measurement can cross in the shared silence and play frames
     twice. A pairwise pass runs after measurement; continuous splits butt-join exactly.

Method (validated on your-job v2.1):
  envelope     5 ms RMS in dB; LOCAL noise floor = 10th pct of a −2s..+2.5s window
  threshold    max(floor + 10 dB, word peak − 28 dB)
  OUT          decay end (sustained 100 ms quiet terminator), hard-capped at
               word.end + 300 ms — widened past low-prob words to the next trusted one
               out = decay + 70 ms, uniform on every segment (authored per-segment
               "air" was retired 2026-08-31 — see SKILL.md; tails never vary)
  IN           onset (40 ms of quiet required before it) − 40 ms
  joints       resolved pairwise after measurement; a continuous split (adjacent kept
               words) shares ONE boundary in the inter-word gap; real-cut overlaps are
               split at the midpoint; a pinned side never moves
  pins         segments arriving with no_refine are LEFT UNTOUCHED (hand-pins survive,
               and the step is idempotent); everything is pinned on output
  long-span    a merged-repeat word (> 1.0 s) at an OUT cuts after its FIRST utterance;
               at an IN the upstream prefer-last snap is kept as authored
  ⚠ lines      no-decay against a killed region, killed-neighbor grafts, long-spans,
               hot cuts — each one is a clipped word / flubbed take candidate: verify
               by slice re-ASR (SKILL.md § Fresh-eyes second pass), never ship unheard

Usage (after splice.sh's refine pass has produced cuts.refined.json):
  python3 polish-boundaries.py <job_dir>
Reads  /tmp/video-editor/<job>/cuts.refined.json (falls back to transcript/cuts.json)
Writes /tmp/video-editor/<job>/cuts.json with every segment pinned, and deletes
cuts.refined.json/cuts.snapped.json so the next splice.sh run consumes the pinned EDL.
Re-run splice.sh after this (RENDER=0 on the FIRST splice of any lane — the render
belongs after this step).
