"""refine-cuts.py — measured onset/offset boundary refinement (the "clipped attack" fix).

WhisperX word-START timestamps run ~50-100 ms LATE vs the real acoustic onset
(measured on real footage: a word timestamped 50.212 whose attack begins at 50.113),
so a cut authored at word.start minus a fixed pad still lands INSIDE the word and
chops its attack. Word-END timestamps run early the same way, clipping decays.

This is NOT a silence-snapper and does not violate the "don't auto-snap cuts to
silence" gotcha: the words Claude chose stay fixed. Per
boundary we MEASURE the chosen word's acoustic edge on a 5 ms RMS envelope of the
raw audio, then move the cut just outside it — clamped so it can never cross the
adjacent word's timestamps or leave the local gap. If there is no clean gap
(continuous speech, deliberate mid-flow split), the authored boundary is untouched.

In-point:  cut = onset − 40 ms   (onset = end of the last sustained-quiet run
                                  before the first kept word's audio)
Out-point: cut = offset + 50 ms  (offset = start of the first sustained-quiet run
                                  after the last kept word's audio)

Both margins exceed a half-frame at 23.976 fps (20.9 ms), so splice.sh's frame-grid
snap can never round the cut back into the word.

Per-segment opt-out: "no_refine": true in cuts.json. A pinned boundary is never
moved, not even by joint resolution: an overlap against a pinned side is repaired
by moving the UNPINNED side only, and with both sides pinned nothing moves
(splice.sh then hard-aborts naming the pair). Continuous splits (one unbroken take
carved into separate timeline clips) are detected by transcript adjacency and
merged to ONE shared boundary by the pairwise joint-resolution pass, so padded
edges can never lay the same source frames down twice.

--repair-only runs ONLY the joint-resolution pass, with zero re-measurement.
Refinement is not idempotent (it measures from the authored cut), so an EDL that
has already been refined or shipped gets repaired with this flag, never a second
full pass.

usage: refine-cuts.py [--repair-only] <media_dir> <words.json> <cuts.json> <out_cuts.json>
Stdlib only. Report goes to stderr; exit 0 with out_cuts.json written (worst case a
verbatim copy), so splice.sh can consume the output unconditionally.
