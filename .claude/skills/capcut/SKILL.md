# To CapCut — Rough Cut Handoff + Live Driving

The CapCut twin of [`premiere-pro`](../premiere-pro/SKILL.md). **Editing apps are the primary finishing path — this is not an "off-ramp."** Premiere is your default app; **CapCut is the lane for CapCut-user clients.** After the rough cut (pipeline step 2), rebuild the cut on a CapCut timeline and do the work there — this skill can carry it all the way to an exported file.

Everything runs through one script: **`lanes/capcut/capcut-bridge.py`** (macOS only, self-contained `uv` header — no venv). Run `uv run lanes/capcut/capcut-bridge.py` with no args to print the full command list.

## 🔒 STEP INDEX — what this lane does at each pipeline step

**This skill carries HOW, never WHAT.** The look, the numbers and the definition of done for every
step live in the format's preset ([`presets/youtube/default/README.md`](../../../presets/youtube/default/README.md)
for long-form). Read the preset for the target, then the row below for the mechanics.
Cross-lane status: [`LANES.md`](../../../LANES.md).

⚠️ **The one habit that must NOT cross from the other lanes: alpha.** CapCut composites ProRes 4444
as **PREMULTIPLIED**; hyperframes renders STRAIGHT, and Premiere and Resolve both want straight.
Convert every CapCut-bound alpha mov first (Procedure 4) or every soft pixel blows out to white. That includes the short-form caption layer (`hf-graphics/captions/renders/captions-alpha.mov`, the plan's `captions` cell): premultiply it, then `add-overlay` it on the top layer for the whole cut.

## Why this is different from every CapCut MCP

CapCut has **no API of any kind** (researched exhaustively 2026-07-27 — see [`lanes/capcut/lab-notes.md`](../../../lanes/capcut/lab-notes.md)). Every "CapCut MCP" on the market blind-writes a draft file and stops there. This bridge does both halves for real:

- **File lane** — writes/edits the plaintext draft JSON CapCut stores under `~/Movies/CapCut/User Data/Projects/com.lveditor.draft/`. Structural, batchable, exact. Requires the app be **quit** during the write (it rewrites its draft registry on exit); the bridge quits + relaunches around each write.
- **Live lane** — drives the *running* app through ByteDance's own internal automation IDs, exposed in the macOS accessibility tree. Find element by name → click its center with a synthesized event → **read state back**. A true locate-act-verify loop, no restart.

**This drives the real desktop app: it takes over mouse, keyboard, and window focus for a few seconds per live action.** Warn before starting a live-lane run if the machine is in use (file-lane writes only need the app quit, no screen takeover). AX ids are internal test hooks, **not a contract** — if anything stops responding after a CapCut update, re-map with `dump` before assuming the bridge broke.

⚠️ **The ruler has a dead strip about 90px wide at its left edge** that silently eats clicks (measured at two zoom levels, fixed in screen space), so the first few seconds of the timeline can't be clicked to directly. `seek` handles it — it lands where it can, then closes the gap with arrow-key frame steps. Those steps must be **paced**: sent back to back CapCut drops most of them (195 sent, 28 applied). `key <k> --times N` paces them for you. Two other focus rules: synthesized input only reaches CapCut when it's frontmost (the bridge activates it before every click and key — when it wasn't, the *first* click was consumed activating the window, which is what made `calibrate` fit garbage), and arrow keys only reach the timeline after something in the timeline has been clicked.

⚠️ **Check for a coach-mark before trusting any live action.** CapCut pops yellow onboarding tooltips ("Right-click the keyframe to create variable speed animations", etc.) that sit *over* the UI and silently swallow clicks in that region — they do **not** appear in the AX tree, so `dump` looks clean and every command reports success while doing nothing. One parked over the left end of the ruler broke `seek` for half an hour: clicks near t=0 vanished, `calibrate` fitted garbage from the one point that did land, and the playhead ended up 40s from target. **If a live action reports success but the state didn't change, `shot` the window and look for a yellow bubble**, then dismiss it with an offset click on its OK. Worth a `shot` at the top of any live session.

## When to use
- Any trigger phrase above, OR a rough cut exists and the job should finish/export in CapCut rather than HyperFrames or Premiere, OR it's a deliverable for a client who edits in CapCut.

If there's no rough cut yet, run `rough-cut` first **with `RENDER=0` on the splice** — same as the Premiere path, the EDL + canonical transcript generate in ~8s with no flat render, and `replay` consumes nothing else. Never render a flat MP4 for a CapCut-finish job.

## The two lanes — pick per action, don't mode-switch up front

| Need | Lane | Restart? |
|---|---|---|
| Build the rough cut from the EDL | file (`replay`) | no — a fresh draft has no cache yet |
| Place graphics / text / transforms in bulk | file (`add-overlay`, `add-text`, `transform`, `remove`, `graphics`) | yes — quits + relaunches (the bridge does it) |
| Interactive trim / split / delete / seek | live (`seek`, `split`, `delete`, `undo`, …) | no |
| Export the finished video | live (`export`) | no |

**Golden rule (learned the hard way, 2026-07-27):** once a draft has been hand-edited in the app, file-lane commands **additive-edit the current `draft_info.json`** — those edits are saved into it on quit. Never regenerate from the EDL over that work; a rebuild clobbered a hand-extended segment. `replay` is for a *fresh* draft only; `add-*`/`transform`/`remove` build on whatever's there.

## Procedure — build → edit → export

1. **Resolve the job.** Newest folder under `projects/` unless one was named. The EDL is `projects/<job>/transcript/cuts.json`; the raw clips are in `projects/<job>/raw/`. Both must exist (same requirement as the Premiere replay).

2. **Build the rough cut:**
   ```
   uv run lanes/capcut/capcut-bridge.py replay <job> [--name <draft>]
   ```
   Writes a whole draft from the EDL — one timeline segment per cut, source times in microseconds, butt-joined so each cut lands where the EDL says (verified 10/10 exact on the intro, zero drift). Draft name defaults to the job name. The raw is **hardlinked** into `<draft>/Resources/` because CapCut's sandbox (`assets.movies.read-write` only) can't read repo paths — a path outside `~/Movies` opens as a red "File not accessible" timeline. `replay` relaunches CapCut when done.

   **Import re-quantizes every cut to the timeline's 30 fps grid** (≤17 ms shift per cut against the 23.976-snapped EDL, which eats into the refine pass's 40 ms onset margin). That is acceptable on this lane — don't fight it, and don't re-run the refine pass to chase it.

3. **Open it and confirm:**
   ```
   uv run lanes/capcut/capcut-bridge.py open <draft>
   uv run lanes/capcut/capcut-bridge.py state --draft <draft>   # JSON snapshot: tracks, exact seg times, unsaved-edit flag
   ```
   `state` reads exact times from disk and compares the live clip count against the saved draft, so it flags unsaved changes.

4. **Place graphics (file lane, batched).** Alpha HyperFrames movs and text both work:
   ```
   uv run lanes/capcut/capcut-bridge.py add-overlay <draft> <path/to/graphic.mov> --at 1.0 [--layer 1] [--dur 3]
   uv run lanes/capcut/capcut-bridge.py add-text   <draft> "built by claude" --at 20 --dur 3
   uv run lanes/capcut/capcut-bridge.py transform  <draft> --track overlay --index 0 --scale 0.6 --y -0.25
   uv run lanes/capcut/capcut-bridge.py remove     <draft> --track text --index 1
   ```
   - **Overlay** = a second video track (`flag: 2`, `render_index` 1). ProRes 4444 alpha composites with true transparency (validated on `g1txt.mov`). `--layer N` stacks higher.
   - **PREMULTIPLY every CapCut-bound alpha mov first.** CapCut composites ProRes 4444 assuming PREMULTIPLIED alpha; hyperframes renders STRAIGHT. Where alpha is 255 the two are identical, which is why solid type (the `g1txt` validation) looked perfect, but every semi-transparent pixel (motion blur, glows, soft shadows, letter fades) composites as `RGB + (1-a)*bg` and blows out to white; motion-blur trails become fat white blobs. Convert before `add-overlay`: `bash lanes/capcut/premultiply.sh <in.mov>` (writes `<in>-premult.mov` beside the input and prints its path). Premiere AND Resolve both assume STRAIGHT (Resolve auto-detects it), so never premultiply a render bound for either — this fix is CapCut-only.
   - **Text** = a text track (`flag: 1`), built from a template lifted from a real draft (`lanes/capcut/capcut-templates/`). The style run is re-pointed at the new string automatically.
   - **transform** — exact scale/position/rotation/opacity written straight into the draft. Position is canvas-normalized (`--y -0.25` shifts up a quarter-frame). This is file-lane on purpose: the inspector's on-screen fields take focus but **ignore synthesized keystrokes**, so the JSON is both the precise and the only reliable path.
   - **graphics** `<draft> <job>` places a whole `graphics-plan.json` in one cache cycle. `--force` on `add-*` allows a deliberate duplicate (there's a guard against an interrupted run double-applying).
   - Batch related edits into **one** invocation where you can — each file-lane command is one quit+relaunch cycle (~15s).

   **Z-order is TRACK stacking, not segment `render_index`.** A segment's `render_index` only orders it *within* its track; what composites is the track's position (`track_render_index` / array order). So `--layer N` is the real z control, and a **text track can't be pushed below a video layer** — CapCut keeps text on top. Type that has to sit *behind* something gets baked to an alpha mov and placed as a video overlay.

5. **Background removal (text-behind-subject, validated 2026-07-27).** Cutout is a live-lane click; the matte itself is CapCut's own AI (needs Pro). The layered build, bottom to top:

   | Layer | What | How |
   |---|---|---|
   | main | the cut, untouched | already there |
   | 1 | black clip, opacity = "background darkness" | `add-overlay <black.mp4> --layer 1` + `transform --opacity 0.3` |
   | 2 | the title, baked alpha ProRes | bake it with `uv run workflows/behind-text.py "line one\|line two" --out projects/<job>/assets/behind-text.mov`, then `add-overlay <title.mov> --layer 2` |
   | 3 | duplicate of the same footage, background removed | `add-overlay <raw> --layer 3 --src <source in-point> --mute --force` |

   `--src` re-lays a slice of the raw above the main track; `--mute` is **mandatory** on that duplicate or its audio doubles the voice. Then enable the matte on the top clip:
   ```
   uv run lanes/capcut/capcut-bridge.py select 0
   uv run lanes/capcut/capcut-bridge.py click "VESettingPanelSubTabControl:Remove BG"
   uv run lanes/capcut/capcut-bridge.py clickxy 2976 286      # the Auto removal checkbox
   ```
   The checkbox is the left edge of `automationaiMattingGroup` — an offset click, like the export dialog (the row exposes no AX child). It writes `matting.flag: 3` plus a mask cache under `<draft>/matting/<hash>/`, keyed on the media, so a second clip off the same raw computes fast. Give it ~20s, then `seek` somewhere else and back to force the preview to re-render.

   **QA gotcha that costs an hour if you miss it:** the top layer is the *same footage* as the main track, so before the matte lands it covers the whole frame — the dim and the title below look like they aren't rendering at all. Don't debug the lower layers off that; confirm with `matting.flag == 3` in the draft JSON, or `delete` the top clip and look.

6. **Motion keyframes — zooms, pushes, moves (validated 2026-07-27).** Same expressive range as Premiere's Effect Controls, and easier to hit exactly, because the values are written rather than typed into a UI:
   ```
   uv run lanes/capcut/capcut-bridge.py keyframe <draft> --track overlay --index 2 --at 0   --scale 1.0
   uv run lanes/capcut/capcut-bridge.py keyframe <draft> --track overlay --index 2 --at 2.0 --scale 1.09
   uv run lanes/capcut/capcut-bridge.py clear-keyframes <draft> --track overlay --index 2
   ```
   Animatable: `--scale` (writes ScaleX+ScaleY together), `--x`, `--y` (canvas-normalized), `--rotate`, `--opacity`. Two calls = a ramp; more calls = a multi-beat move. `--at` is **timeline** seconds and must land inside the segment (the bridge converts to the segment-relative `time_offset` CapCut stores). Re-keying the same time replaces that point.

   Under the hood it's `common_keyframes` on the segment: one entry per `property_type` (`KFTypeScaleX`, `KFTypePositionY`, `KFTypeRotation`, `KFTypeAlpha`, …), each holding a `keyframe_list` of `{time_offset µs, values: [v], curveType}`.

   ⚠️ **`time_offset` is in the SOURCE time domain, not segment-relative** — a point is `source_timerange.start + (t − target start)`. This is the single thing to get right, and it fails silently: segment-relative offsets fall outside a cut's source window and CapCut collapses the whole animation to **one static value** rather than erroring, so the clip looks zoomed but never moves. It also hides during testing — probe on a clip whose source in-point is 0 and the two domains are identical. Verify on a real cut, and verify by parking the playhead *between* two keyframes and reading the inspector: an interpolated value (100 → **112** → 122) is proof; matching the last keyframe means it flattened.

   **Only `curveType: "Line"` (linear) is verified** — `--curve` passes a value through, but the app's ease-curve names haven't been probed, so anything else is a guess. For an eased move, stack extra keyframes instead.

   Keyframing the cutout layer *alone* pushes the subject while the background holds still — a real parallax move, and the reason to keep the cutout as its own layer.

7. **Interactive edits (live lane, no restart)** — for the surgical stuff:
   ```
   uv run lanes/capcut/capcut-bridge.py seek 42.0 --draft <draft>   # frame-exact, closed-loop
   uv run lanes/capcut/capcut-bridge.py split 30.0                  # razor at a time (or at the playhead)
   uv run lanes/capcut/capcut-bridge.py delete 3                    # select clip 3 + delete
   uv run lanes/capcut/capcut-bridge.py undo | redo | marker | zoomfit | play | playhead | clips
   ```
   `seek` clicks the mapped ruler point then nudges with arrow keys until the app's own `currentProgress` readout hits the exact frame — it **self-calibrates** from that readout, so it survives any zoom/scroll state.

8. **Export (validated end-to-end 2026-07-27):**
   ```
   uv run lanes/capcut/capcut-bridge.py export [--to <dir>] [--timeout 400]
   ```
   Drives CapCut's real export dialog and **verifies the file that lands** (defaults: 1080p HEVC mp4 into `~/Downloads`, the draft name). Proven raw EDL → alpha overlay + programmatic text → rendered file with both graphics baked in (confirmed by frame-grab). Leaves cloud-sync off. Screen is controlled for ~10s (escape stale modal → Export → confirm), then it's pure file-polling while CapCut renders — the machine is free during the render.

   **A wedged export** (the encoder freezing mid-render, always a `source_timerange: null` on some segment) needs `kill -9` — the modal blocks a graceful quit — plus a `Timelines/` delete before relaunch.

## Step 3 — audio polish (no scripted route: bake it into the source)

⚠️ **Unvalidated. No job has run this.** The bridge has no audio-effects surface — the draft JSON
carries clip volume but nothing resembling the house Amplify + Hard Limiter chain, and the live AX
lane cannot type into the inspector's numeric fields (they take focus and ignore synthesized
keystrokes, which is why `transform` is file-lane on purpose).

**The recipe that follows from what IS known**, and the same shape the Resolve lane uses for the
same reason: apply the chain to the SOURCE file with ffmpeg **before** `replay`, so the draft is
built against already-polished media.

1. Measure the kept ranges from `transcript/cuts.json` (`volumedetect` or `ebur128` on the raw).
2. `volume=<G>dB` into the house `alimiter` (the `level=disabled:latency=1` locks) on the raw, into
   `projects/<job>/audio/` — **never into `raw/`**, or `transcribe.sh` globs it as an extra clip on
   a `--force` re-run.
3. Remux the polished audio against the original video (stream-copy the video so the EDL stays
   frame-exact), then `replay` against that file.

The same ffmpeg shape is already implemented in
[`lanes/resolve/resolve-audio-polish/normalize-sections.sh`](../../../lanes/resolve/resolve-audio-polish/normalize-sections.sh)
(drift gate, `level=disabled:latency=1`, `-c:v copy`) — read it as the reference implementation, but
keep this lane's numbers (kept speech → −17 LUFS, −6 dBFS limiter) and write into `audio/`, not
`audio-normalized/`.

**Doing it after the draft exists means swapping media under a draft, which is the one thing this
lane must not do** — a media swap under an existing draft raced CapCut's async shutdown save and
zeroed a `draft_info.json` once. If a draft already exists and its audio needs work, delete the
draft plus its registry row and `replay` fresh against the fixed media.

## Step 4 — color grade (a gap on this lane)

⛔ **No recipe.** The bridge exposes no LUT or colour surface, and nothing has been probed. The
preset's contract still stands (footage graded, graphics untouched, before graphics are placed), so:

- Hand-apply a filter or LUT in CapCut before the graphics go on, **or**
- Ship the cut ungraded.

Either way **say which, out loud**, and record it in `projects/<job>/RUN.md`. A quietly ungraded cut
is the failure mode this line exists to prevent.

## Lab-Notes locks — read before trusting any step

The locks live in [`lanes/capcut/lab-notes.md`](../../../lanes/capcut/lab-notes.md); the war stories behind them are in the engineering archive. The six that bite most often, one line each:

- **`Timelines/` cache** — JSON edits after a draft's first open are silently ignored.
- **`source_timerange: null` WEDGES the encoder** mid-render; `edit_draft` backfills them.
- **The post-export share screen is MODAL** and publishes if you click through it.
- **Keystrokes only reach CapCut when it's frontmost** — the bridge calls `ensure_front` before any key; clicks are positional and don't need it.
- **Import re-quantizes cuts to the 30 fps grid** (≤17 ms/cut) — Procedure 2 above.
- **No real API is buildable** — CDP reaches no timeline state, dylib injection means reversing a stripped 655 MB engine; the live AX lane is the answer.

## Relationship to the rest of the repo
- **Premiere** stays your finishing surface ([`premiere-pro`](../premiere-pro/SKILL.md)); both ship. Route to CapCut only on an explicit CapCut ask or a CapCut-user client deliverable.
- The bridge consumes the same `transcript/cuts.json` EDL the Premiere replay does — one rough cut feeds either app.
- Ships in the client package as the CapCut-user client lane (macOS only — the bridge is macOS desktop automation, so it's dormant on Windows/Linux installs).
