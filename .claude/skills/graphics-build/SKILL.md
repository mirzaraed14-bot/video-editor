description: "Owns the graphics BUILD (step 5b): consumes the job’s graphics-plan.json and drives the whole build — harness setup, asset prep, comp authoring per storyboard cell, browser probe, part renders, placement on the target surface (Premiere / Resolve / CapCut / chat-only ffmpeg), first-pass QA — ending with every planned graphic placed and ready for your review. Carries the render gotchas and the long-graphic part-split SOP; routes lane mechanics to the app skills and the chat-only assemble sheet. Does NOT decide graphics (graphics-plan does) and does NOT do music/export (the short-form caption layer IS one of its graphics). Triggers: build the graphics, build the planned graphics, execute the graphics plan, graphics build, run the build, composite the graphics, place the graphics on the timeline."

# Graphics Build — from plan to placed graphics, one owner

**Step 5b of the pipeline.** `graphics-plan` decided everything; this skill EXECUTES it: every
`graphic:true` beat built exactly as storyboarded, rendered, and placed on the target surface.
Done = all planned graphics on the timeline (or composited, chat-only lane), a build report, and
nothing left for you but to watch it and call adjustments.

**The bar: one-shot fidelity.** The plan is the contract — build what it says, at the times it
says, with the copy it says, verbatim. A better idea at build time is a NOTE in the report, never
a silent change (same rule as the tier gate: escalation and deviation are your calls). If a
cell is unbuildable exactly as written (a timing that will not fit, a prop or effect that will not
render), build the closest faithful version and flag it `⚠️` in the report — don't stall, don't
redesign. A missing REQUIRED SOURCE is the exception: keep building the independent cells and
report that specific unresolved source, never a generic stand-in and never 'complete'. If a cell
conflicts with the original request or the preset, that is a plan defect — fix it in
`graphics-plan` before building; a plan cannot waive a requirement it forgot.

**Style comes from the plan's `preset` doc, and only that preset's docs.** Presets are independent;
never pull style from another preset's folder.

## The build loop — one graphic at a time, converged before the next (2026-08-29)

Stages 3–6 below run **PER GRAPHIC, in plan order**: author → probe → render → place → check the
real composite (program monitor / lane readback) → judge it against the plan cell, the preset
locks, and the Definition of Done → fix and re-render **until THAT graphic is right**, then move
to the next. Never park a known defect "for the review loop" — nothing broken moves forward.

**Effort scales with complexity.** A simple text animation: build, verify sync + layout, done —
minutes. A full-screen / punch-cut / multi-element graphic: expect multiple rounds (~10 min is
the working budget; the first generation of a complex graphic is usually NOT right — layout,
hierarchy, and arrow/prop craft take passes). Judge each round the way you would: placement,
sizing, balance, sync, readability — from the actual composite, not the comp render.

When every graphic has individually converged, Stage 7 runs the all-up QA and hands the draft to
the **final `edit-review` loop, which runs until zero defects** (stops on the first clean round) —
it catches what only the full sequence shows (cross-graphic rhythm, boundary bleeds, variation
collisions); it is not a substitute for per-graphic convergence.

## Stage 0 — preconditions

- `projects/<job>/graphics-plan.json` exists. If not → stop, run `graphics-plan` first.
- The rough cut ran (canonical transcript + EDL exist). Frame-snapped splice ⇒ **plan times ARE
  timeline times** — anchor comps and placements to them directly, no offset hunting.
- If dialogue was cut, restored or appended after planning, reconcile the plan against the final transcript first. Rebuild coverage through the actual outro; previous QA applies only to unchanged windows.
- **Target surface** = the plan's `"compositor"` (`premiere` · `resolve` · `capcut` · absent =
  chat-only HyperFrames finish). App lanes need their bridge/app available — ping first, per the
  app skill.

## Stage 1 — harness

Set up the durable generated build under **`projects/<job>/hf-graphics/`** (never `/tmp` — a full
day of build source was wiped by macOS's overnight `/tmp` clear once).

**Copy the harness the job's preset ships.** `presets/youtube/default` names the files and the
locked chains in its § Build (`default-overlay-style.md`) — copy those in rather than re-deriving
them; on a preset that does not ship one, author `render.sh` from
[`presets/youtube/default/reference/fullscreen-render.sh`](../../../presets/youtube/default/reference/fullscreen-render.sh).
Add `PROJECT.md` (the resume doc: write it now, update as you go, so any fresh session can pick up
mid-build). **Symlink `compositions/assets → ../assets` and `compositions/hf-anim.js → ../hf-anim.js`:**
every comp refers to `hf-anim.js` and `assets/…` by the bare names the renderer resolves against the
gfx root, and without the links the Stage-4 localhost probe 404s them from `compositions/` (fonts
fall back silently, the registry throws).

**THE REGISTRY AS CODE, non-negotiable:** every comp starts as a copy of
[`reference/comp-scaffold.html`](../../../presets/youtube/default/reference/comp-scaffold.html) and
loads **`hf-anim.js`** (copied into `hf-graphics/gfx/` from
[`presets/youtube/default/reference/hf-anim.js`](../../../presets/youtube/default/reference/hf-anim.js));
it declares its rate (`HF.init({fps, dur[, stepFps: 12]})`) and CALLS `pop`/`slam`/`riseIn`/`exit`/
`slideIn`/`slideOut`/`camera`/`float`/`arrow`/`countUp`/`reveal`. Helper blocks are NEVER re-typed
into a comp (2026-09-02: eleven
comps each re-typed them and each got a different subset wrong — nine of ten motion defects).
**A full-screen / punch-cut cell starts from the preset's shipped reference implementation instead of
the bare scaffold** — [`reference/punch-cut-text-light.html`](../../../presets/youtube/default/reference/punch-cut-text-light.html)
for a bg-light TEXT punch-cut, [`reference/punch-cut-reference.html`](../../../presets/youtube/default/reference/punch-cut-reference.html)
for a bg-dark artifact: the scaffold is the OVERLAY shape and carries none of the scene / `#racked` /
`camera()` structure `creative-moves.md` move 2 requires (and `graphics-qa.py`'s `dynamics` and `rack`
checks measure). The
presets that own it: `presets/youtube/default/animations.md` § The canonical block; enforced by
`workflows/graphics-qa.py`.

- On the **basic tier** (4–7 short cards) each card is its **own independent comp** — no shared
  timelines, no part-splitting; a tweak re-renders one ~2s comp. **A `build.py` emitter is for
  the split-part case only** (a long multi-scene graphic, below) — do not build one for a set of
  short independent cards.
- **Stale tracking (split-part builds only):** stamp `renders/<id>.sha` with the hash of the comp
  each render came from and give the emitter a `--stale` mode that diffs comp-hash vs stamp. On a
  set of independent card comps there is nothing to track — one comp, one render.
  Parts of a shared-timeline chain embed the whole timeline, so touching one shared element marks
  every part of the chain stale — the seam-coupling rule, enforced instead of memorized.

## Stage 2 — assets

Everything a cell needs, gathered before any comp is authored:

- **Generated motion clips** (`b-roll` / `motion-graphic` cells with no real footage) →
  generated with your AI-video tool of choice, into `projects/<job>/broll/`. Its style block comes from THIS preset only.
- **Screenshots / screen-recs** → a cell with `asset` names a file already in the job folder (a
  missing one is a `⚠️` in the report, not a guess). A cell with `capture` is RECORDED here, into
  `projects/<job>/assets/captures/<id>.{mp4,png}`, by source:
  · Public `url` → `node workflows/page-record.mjs <url> <out.mp4>
    --seconds N --scroll <px> --fps <the job's rate> [--dark] [--hide "<css>"]` (a `.png` out = a still),
    a separate clean headless Chrome at 1920×1080@2x. Verify the rendered page is the intended
    destination; a login or sales-page redirect is not evidence of a private community or lesson.
  · A page behind a login → an `app` capture of the signed-in browser: `FPS=<the job's rate>
    ./workflows/screen-record.sh <Browser> <out.mp4> <seconds>` in the background (a still =
    `window-grab.sh`), driving the plan's `action` during the take. Full-screen the window (or
    frame the chrome out in the comp) so tabs and toolbars stay out of shot; verify the recorded
    page is the real destination — a login or sales-page redirect is not evidence. If the page
    cannot be reached, report that exact gap; never capture the redirect.
  · `app` → a still = `./workflows/window-grab.sh <App> <out.png>` (reads a covered window's own
    buffer, never fronts anything); a recording = `FPS=<the job's rate> ./workflows/screen-record.sh <App> <out.mp4>
    <seconds> [index]` **run in the background** — video cannot read a covered window (`screencapture -v`
    ignores the window id, measured 2026-09-11), so it fronts the app for the take: start it, wait
    ~1 s, drive the plan's `action` (a click, the timeline filling) with the computer-use tools,
    let it stop by itself, and say in the report that the app was fronted.
  All recordings must finish as a CONSTANT-rate mp4 at the rate you pass (default 29.97; a 24/25 fps job MUST pass
  its own, `FPS=` / `--fps`). Copy the file into `hf-graphics/gfx/assets/captures/` (the render
  base, reachable from `compositions/` through the Stage-1 symlinks). A page records at 2x
  (3840×2160) and a Retina window at 2x its point size, which is what a screen-recording-heavy job's
  4K master wants (preset README § Resolution). The capture is scaled and framed INSIDE the comp
  to `default-overlay-style.md` § SCREEN-REC SCENES (straight frame, the label and arrow on the
  label's side, bg-light), never parked full-frame; text is never captured: a prompt, command or
  quote on screen is rebuilt verbatim from the exact original written source, not reconstructed
  from its spoken summary (`graphics-plan` § THE CAPTURE GATE). For a narrated prompt walkthrough,
  keep the complete prompt full-screen throughout the explanation and highlight the actual source
  clauses on their word anchors; a shortened paraphrase or separate caption does not satisfy it.
- **Fonts** → copy the preset's font files into `hf-graphics/assets/fonts/` and `@font-face`
  them (headless render needs the file; a system name silently falls back).
- **Split-frame explainer (the `signature-style.md` full tier):** measure the face crop first —
  `uv run workflows/face-frame.py <base-cut>` — and use the printed `object-position` verbatim
  (`--verify <draft>` must PASS before review). The basic explainer tier lays cards over the
  untouched 9:16 raw and needs no crop.
- **A graphic that tracks a HAND:** `uv run workflows/hand-track.py <video> [--out track.json]` —
  it follows the PALM CENTROID, never a fingertip. A tracked graphic may span only a continuous RAW
  run of the track (no interpolating across a dropout), and the path is **baked into the render**,
  never authored as editor keyframes.
- **Long-form, any overlay that shares the frame with your face:** measure the chin line first —
  `uv run workflows/chin-line.py <base-cut>` — and build every under-the-face comp inside the
  band it prints (`presets/youtube/default/default-overlay-style.md` § THE LOW BAND). The
  text-animation builder takes it as `TOP_MIN`; hand-authored comps put it in a header comment. A
  stack too tall for the band scales down WHOLE — never push past the floor to keep type big.
  On an app-finish job (`RENDER=0`, no flat cut exists), point `chin-line.py` at the RAW main
  take — it samples frames, so killed regions only add samples and the floor stays conservative.
- **Motion blur (2026-09-10): a timeline-rate comp that slides, moves its camera or pops something large renders with `MBLUR=1 MBLUR_SS=8 MBLUR_SHUTTER=5`** (the registry's smear is already in the comp; the supersample is the other half — `creative-moves.md` 4b). Never on a `STEP_FPS=12` render.
- **A side callout is built to the zone `chin-line.py --edl` prints for ITS window** (x80 → head−60
  on the left, head+60 → x1840 on the right, `--step 0.1` so the worst frame is in the sweep): the
  card is as wide as the room (cap 620) and its inner widths follow, never the fixed 620 box; the
  plan cell's `head` is the number `graphics-qa.py`'s `face` check holds the render to (preset
  § SIDE CALLOUTS, you 2026-09-10).

## Stage 3 — author the comps

- **Name the sound the situation wants while you author (2026-09-10).** The SFX map is the default; when an element SHOWS something the map's mechanical sound does not tell — a recording starting, a message landing, a finished state, a sale — put `data-sfx="<event>"` on that element, naming an event DOCUMENTED in `sfx.json` and nothing else (`presets/youtube/default/sfx.md` § Sound follows MEANING: an undocumented file cannot be heard, so it is never placed), and step 6 hears it. A green completion state rings the bell on its own.

One comp per storyboard cell, straight from the plan: the cell's `template` from the preset doc
(an older plan may carry only `kind` + `content` — derive the template from those and note it),
its `copy` **verbatim** (never paraphrase on-screen words), its `region`/side, its motion note.
Timing: comp durations and placement times come from the cell's `start`/`end` — word-snapped
already, don't re-time. The preset doc's CSS/tokens are the lock; design freedom lives INSIDE the
template, not around it. HyperFrames authoring detail → the `hyperframes-core` / `-animation` /
`-keyframes` skills.

- **Edit comp and `build.py` source with exact-anchor edits, never shell-heredoc string surgery.**
  One `python3 - <<'PYEOF'` pass over a builder failed three ways at once: it wrote a literal
  backspace byte where `\b` was meant, so the build guard it added matched nothing and **passed
  everything silently**; an `s[:i] + new + s[j:]` splice deleted a whole definition sitting between
  its two anchors; and two more replaces no-op'd because an earlier pass in the same run had already
  moved their target. An anchored edit fails loudly when its anchor is gone — that is the point. For
  a genuinely bulk mechanical pass, write a real script file, `assert` every anchor exists, and
  **grep for survivors of the old pattern before rendering**: a regex that cannot span nested parens
  converts the easy cases and leaves the rest, which is how a "fixed" pivot bug once survived a full
  render cycle.

### Long graphics ship as split part clips (LOCKED SOP — 2026-07-21)

Render time is **linear in comp duration** and a tweak re-renders the whole comp, so a long
multi-scene graphic (one grew to 19s ≈ 85s + 1.5 GB per tweak) ships as **short part clips,
butt-joined** — adjacent clips on the app timeline, or adjacent segments in the chat-only
composite. Split even when scenes flow continuously; split on a transition if that's where the
cut wants to be — the seam just has to frame-match.

- **Persistent state belongs in the initial CSS.** A carried prompt highlight or other settled
  state must exist before GSAP runs; a zero-time `tl.set` can rewind during seek-render and flash
  the unhighlighted baseline. Keep initial CSS and timeline state consistent.
- **Frame-match by construction:** ONE shared timeline for the whole graphic in `build.py`; emit
  each part with a start offset — `emit("g2", durA, ...)` + `emit("g2b", durB, ..., t0=durA)`.
  The emit template wraps `tl` in a shim that shifts every position by `−t0` and collapses any
  set/tween ending before the seam into its END state at time 0 — part N+1's first frame IS part
  N's last frame, pixel-identical. (GSAP note: `master.add(tl, -t0)` does NOT work — negative
  positions get clamped; the shim is the way.)
- **Cut on exact frame counts:** part durations = `k * 1001/24000` (23.976) so clips butt-join on
  the frame grid with no gap or overlap.
- **Coupling rule:** a change visible at the seam = re-render BOTH adjacent parts; a change
  contained inside one part = that part only (`--stale` enforces this).
- **Motion THROUGH a seam = per-frame `tl.set`s on FRAME-INTEGER times** — a `.to()` straddling
  the seam gets clamped by the shim. Compute each set's time as `frameIndex * 1001/24000 - 0.0005`
  (the guard keeps every set safely before its frame sample in BOTH parts; a rounded decimal base
  lands one part a frame late → a double-step stutter exactly at the seam). Verify a mid-motion
  seam by measuring the moving element across the 4 frames spanning the join (smooth easing
  steps), never by diffing the two seam frames (adjacent real-motion frames SHOULD differ).
- **Grain is free at seams:** grain flicker alternates every few frames anyway, so the grain-phase
  flip at a seam is invisible (and defeats the renderer's static-frame dedup).
- **Native seam proof:** after placement inspect the last outgoing frame and the first THREE
  incoming frames at every split, plus the motion samples above. Check persistent highlights,
  background and text continuity; a midpoint frame or contiguous clip bounds cannot prove this.
- **Premiere side:** each part = its own project item + clip (per-part `refreshMedia`); baked
  Transform keys live on the part that plays them.

## Stage 4 — probe before render

**Rendering to find out whether a comp works is the most expensive habit in this pipeline** — a
part render is 1.5–3.5 min; seeking the paused timeline in the Browser pane is one tool call.
**Serve over localhost, never `file://` (2026-08-29):** the Browser pane pins a `file://` comp to a
static `data:` snapshot — relative assets (images, fonts) 404 silently and rect coordinates come
back scaled/garbage, which reads as a layout bug that isn't there. Start the repo's `probe`
server (`.claude/launch.json`: `preview_start {name: "probe"}`, a static server on 8123 rooted at
the repo: never a Bash-run server) and open
`http://localhost:8123/projects/<job>/hf-graphics/<folder>/compositions/<id>.html`; `resize_window`
to 1920×1080 on that tab makes screenshots capture the full frame. Then measure MECHANICS: positions, pivots, whether a
tween fired, whether frame 0 is the settled seam state:

```js
(() => { const t = window.__timelines.main, o = {};
  [8, 24, 50, 80].forEach(f => { t.seek(f * 1001 / 30000);          // fps of THIS job
    const e = document.getElementById('gear1'), b = e.getBoundingClientRect();
    o['f'+f] = [Math.round(b.x + b.width/2), Math.round(b.y + b.height/2), e.getAttribute('transform')];
  }); return o; })()
```

The failures this catches are invisible in a contact sheet: a wrongly-pivoted element still
animates, it just orbits, so the sheet reads as "odd design" rather than "bug". Two traps:
**`seek(0)` when the timeline is already at 0 is a no-op** (seek away and back), and
`location.reload()` inside a probe kills the execution context (re-`navigate` with `force: true`).
When seeking through `page.evaluate`, use a block returning no value: `t => { window.__timelines.main.seek(t); }`. Returning a paused GSAP timeline returns a thenable and can hang the probe.

**Shape the probe so it RULES CANDIDATES OUT.** When something comes out wrong, the next action is
ONE measurement that discriminates between the candidate causes — never a patch based on the
likeliest one. Run every candidate in the SAME call, on the same element, and compare the readbacks
(`svgOrigin` vs `transformOrigin` vs the untouched attribute, each read back through
`getBoundingClientRect()`); three guessed pivot fixes with a render between each burned ~15 min on a
bug one three-line probe settled in a single call. The same shape holds off the comps: a readback
that cannot separate two causes is not a check — frame 9 alone does not tell an `inout` bake from a
linear one (§ Stage 7, 3f). **And when a check passes while the symptom persists, suspect the
check** — print what actually ran (`inspect.getsource`, `repr()` of the generated string, `grep` the
emitted file) before touching the subject again.

**Scope: mechanics on new or structural work.** On second-pass nudges of a locked graphic, skip
visual self-QA entirely — edit, render the part, show; the fixes get called live from the review.

## Stage 5 — render

Part-by-part via the harness scripts, at the base footage's fps, `-q standard` (the part render
IS final quality — no separate "final render" step):

- **Overlays** (cards, text animations, enacting overlays — anything that composites over
  footage) → **alpha ProRes 4444, straight alpha** on every app lane; never premultiply.
- **Full-screen GRAPHICS** (punch-cut graphics — anything that REPLACES the frame) → **opaque mp4
  with the film-grain pass baked**, via `render.sh <id> full` (the reference renderer's `full`
  mode does grain + libx264 crf 14 in one chain). bg-DARK full-screens add `STEP_FPS=12` AND the
  glow pass; bg-LIGHT gets neither.
- **Section title cards** → the preset's own `titles/render.sh` **unmodified** (its signature is
  `render.sh [id ...]` — there is no mode argument, and it bakes NO grain, by design). Don't route
  them through the full-screen chain.
- **CapCut lane only** → premultiply every alpha mov (CapCut reads 4444 as premultiplied; straight
  renders blow out soft pixels).
- **Re-renders get a NEW versioned filename** — overwriting a placed file half-stales Premiere's
  frame index (random transparent frames) and CapCut silently serves the old file.

### Render gotchas (learned, don't relearn)

- **Pin the CLI version in every render script.** A bare `npx hyperframes` floats to whatever
  shipped last (the 0.7.42 contract break landed mid-job exactly this way). Every render script —
  the copied `render.sh`, and any emitter — calls `npx hyperframes@<tested version>` — currently `0.8.16` for new jobs (validated 2026-08-27:
  png-sequence A/B vs 0.7.92 on the titles builder — opaque frames pixel-identical 90/90,
  alpha 233 px of glyph AA across the whole clip; never 0.7.67). Jobs already
  rendering on an older pin keep it. Bump deliberately: edit, re-render one part, review, adopt.
- **Panels must read on their OWN fill.** An isolated alpha render has nothing behind it, so
  `backdrop-filter` does nothing — design opaque-bright surfaces, never live backdrop blur.
- **Match fps to the base** (`--fps 24000/1001` for 23.976 footage) or overlays drift.
- **No raw emoji glyphs — they HANG the headless render** (Chrome spins at 100% CPU resolving the
  system color-emoji font; never errors, never times out — a 5s part burned 5+ min before being
  killed). Fake the look in the brand font, or bake the glyph to a PNG with
  `uv run workflows/bake-emoji.py rocket=🚀 --out projects/<job>/hf-graphics/assets/emoji`.
  Smell test: a render at ~3× its siblings' time on a same-length part = kill it, look for a glyph.
- **An exit tween must finish INSIDE the clip's `data-duration`, plus a hard-kill**
  (`tl.set("#id",{opacity:0}, <next-clip-start>)`) — HyperFrames hard-hides a clip at its window
  end, so a mid-dissolve exit POPS. Lint catches only the missing hard-kill half; the
  too-short-duration half passes lint and pops in the video.
- **A fixed-pivot rotate/scale on an SVG element goes in the SVG `transform` ATTRIBUTE** —
  `rotate(deg cx cy)`, per-frame `gsap.set` of the attribute string is fine. GSAP `rotation` +
  `transformOrigin`/`svgOrigin` on SVG displaces the pivot (measured on 3.14.2), and a later bare
  `{rotation:N}` tween silently reverts it — the element still animates, it just orbits, which is
  exactly what the Stage-4 probe exists to catch.
- **Never pre-position a GSAP-tweened element with CSS `transform`** — the stylesheet transform
  gets absorbed into GSAP's cache and a later `x`/`xPercent` tween nets the wrong end position.
  GSAP owns position; set initial poses via `tl.set(...)`.
- **ALL CSS inline in the comp** — a `<link rel="stylesheet">` silently does not load in the
  headless render (zero error, zero lint; fonts fall back to serif, classes vanish). Smell test:
  brand font rendering as Times.
- **A staggered `fromTo` whose from-pose changes glyph geometry needs `immediateRender:false`** —
  GSAP applies from-poses at build time by default, so pre-scaled glyph boxes eat the margins and
  un-revealed text renders packed together.
- **Benign lint noise — don't "fix":** `duplicate_media_discovery_risk` (warning),
  `missing_local_asset: <id>-base.mp4` (clears when the slice is cut),
  `timeline_track_too_dense` (warning), `missing_three_script` (false positive on `+esm` imports).
- **Never tween a CSS `filter` string for a state change: dim with a black scrim's opacity instead (your-job g10, 2026-09-07).** `tl.to('.wall', {filter: 'grayscale(0.7) brightness(0.30)'})` from a CSS-declared `brightness(0.55)` interpolated from brightness(0) on the seek-render (an explicit `fromTo` did not help), so the wall blinked near-black for three 12 fps frames; both reviewers caught it on the composite. A numeric opacity tween on an overlay element cannot misparse; `graphics-qa.py`'s `source` lint fails a `filter` tween (`tl.set` is the discrete escape hatch).
- **A 4K render of a 1080 comp = the 1080 layout on a `#stage{width:1920px;height:1080px;transform:scale(2);transform-origin:0 0}` inside a 3840x2160 `#root`, never `#root{zoom:2}` (your-job, 2026-09-07).** Under CSS zoom Chrome double-resolves the percentages inside a `transform-origin` and a gradient position: the three punch-cuts' centred `scale(0.92)` pivoted on the corner (77x43 px off) and the vignette landed on the bottom-right corner, while the 24 overlays, carrying no such percentage, came out pixel-identical and hid the fault. Prove any resolution change with `uv run workflows/render-diff.py <new> <old>` (the previous render downscaled, exit 1 on a difference), never by reading a layout back; `graphics-qa.py` repeats that proof as its `parity` check.
- **Never GSAP-`transform` a `<video>` element — it silently drops from the render** (the face
  vanishes, no error). Footage moves on app lanes are baked in-app (Transform keys / Fusion);
  on the chat-only lane use the wrapper-box / ffseg recipes in
  [`lanes/chat-only/incremental-graphics.md`](../../../lanes/chat-only/incremental-graphics.md).

## Stage 6 — place

Route to the lane's own doc — this skill orders the work, the lane doc carries the mechanics:

| Compositor | Recipe |
|---|---|
| `resolve` | the `davinci-resolve` skill § Step 5 ([`LANES.md`](../../../LANES.md) § step 5) — a per-job `hf-graphics/place.py`, idempotent + readback-verified |
| `premiere` | **`uv run lanes/premiere/place-graphics.py projects/<job> --plan --write` then `--apply`**, one owner for `hf-graphics/placement.json` and the graphics tracks: derives every row from the plan + the newest render version, places what is not yet on the timeline, swaps stale versions, reads every write back; `--verify` is the readback, `--sync-plan` writes frame-snapped times back into the plan so plan-fidelity never argues over a rounding (2026-09-02: eight hand ES batches + two reconciliations). Mechanics underneath: the `premiere-pro` skill § Step 5 (V3 on youtube/default: V1 footage, V2 grade, V3 graphics; baked footage moves on V1 via the bridge `zoom`; AME banned) |
| `capcut` | the `capcut` skill — `lanes/capcut/capcut-bridge.py add-overlay` (+ `--force` rules) |
| chat-only | [`lanes/chat-only/incremental-graphics.md`](../../../lanes/chat-only/incremental-graphics.md) — the ffmpeg assemble lane (kept for no-app clients; not the primary path) |

**The caption layer (short-form presets, on by default — 2026-09-04)** is built and placed
here like any other graphic: `uv run presets/tiktok/raw/build.py projects/<job> --alpha` (TikTok/raw)
or the explainer `build.py` copy with `ALPHA = True` (`captions-style.md` § Per-job workflow) writes
`hf-graphics/captions/renders/captions-alpha.mov`; the plan's `captions` cell makes `place-graphics.py`
derive its row onto the top graphics track (V5 on Premiere, above every other overlay), and the
chat-only assemble takes it as one more overlay. Long-form has no caption layer.

**Replacement consistency:** after a new render, prove the chain from active comp/spec → versioned
render → placement row → live clip media path, source in/out and timeline bounds. Confirm media
is online, the clip enabled, its track visible/unmuted, and the new frame visible in the native
composite before saving; a JSON row alone is not placement proof. If an ID changes template
(e.g. caption → real capture), retire its old comp AND builder spec from scanned folders so the
SFX scanner cannot choose the obsolete animation. Keep archived source outside those folders.
Reconcile SFX for affected IDs: merge reviewed new cues into the existing plan while preserving
approved cues/levels elsewhere, then place and verify missing, duplicate, orphaned and shifted
cues, including after an interruption.

Long-form structure (section title cards, SFX whoosh, track map) is the **preset README's**
territory (e.g. `presets/youtube/default/`) — place graphics onto that architecture, don't invent
tracks.

## Stage 7 — first-pass QA + report

**The gate first (2026-09-02):**

```bash
uv run workflows/graphics-qa.py projects/<job> --json projects/<job>/hf-graphics/qa-report.json
```

Non-zero exit = not done; fix and re-run until it is green. **What it owns mechanically is its own
`Checks` / `Not here` docstring block — read that, not a copy of it** (`sed -n '1,50p'
workflows/graphics-qa.py`). **A deliberate deviation is a line in
`hf-graphics/qa-waivers.json`** (`{"g18": {"band": "DOWN arrow reaches the floor by design"}}`),
never a sentence in the report: the review loop reads the JSON and treats prose as no evidence.
Items 1–3g below are what the script cannot check — plus, in one line each, the ones it does, kept
only as a pointer to what to look at when a check fails.

Verify, then report — never hand over unverified work:

1. **Render format + duration per ROLE** — the gate owns this (`render`, `duration`, `grain`
   fields in the qa-report; section title cards are exempt from grain by design).
2. **Placement readback:** every overlay at its planned time on the right track (each lane doc's
   readback method). Timeline count == plan's `graphic:true` count. The gate cross-checks this
   against the plan (`plan`, `holes`); the readback itself is yours.
3. **Composite spot-check:** 2–3 real composite frames at the strongest cells (Resolve: a real
   render, never `get_thumbnail_image`; Premiere: the bridge `frame` command / `window-grab.sh`,
   never fronting the app; chat-only: ffmpeg frame of the assembled file). Verify against the
   plan's cell: right copy, right side, face clear.
3b. **Band + edge sweep (long-form)** — the gate owns this (`band` field, every frame of every
   render). When it fails, look at the comp's box geometry in the browser probe rather than
   eyeballing a composite.
3c. **Prop-glow check (long-form):** for every accent prop
   (icons and glyphs inside cards and nodes included), measure its own colour's light
   OUTSIDE the prop's box on the finished render (a masked fill's `box-shadow` renders nothing
   — `default-overlay-style.md` § THE PROP GLOW). A comparison against the previous render is
   the fastest form: zero accent pixels outside the box means the glow never existed.
3d. **Registry + float conformance (long-form) — AUTHORED graphic comps only.** The mechanical
   half (registry constants, relative `riseOut`, `float()` on a wrapper over `0 → DUR`, helper
   integrity, the 12 fps form, no `flash` at 12 fps) is the gate's `source` check; the preset's
   generated builders (`text-animation/`, `titles/`) are exempt from conformance — their motion is
   locked in the builder, so "conformant" there means the builder was used unmodified. **Three
   judgments the script cannot make, and you must:** (a) the entrance split against ROLE — peers
   share one preset, the odd element out carries the contrast; (b) the RENDER FLAGS against the
   `bg` field — a bg-DARK full-screen renders `STEP_FPS=12` AND carries the glow pass (the pair
   travels together), a bg-LIGHT one gets NEITHER; (c) a full-screen's FIRST element entering on
   frame 0 with zero blank lead when that element is near-full-frame, and rising rather than
   popping — **measure it on the render with a heavy-downscale structural diff, not an edge count,
   or grain swamps it** (the defect scales with the element's size). The registry itself:
   `presets/youtube/default/animations.md`.
3d-1. **Zero-frame pins** — the gate owns this (`source`: content reveals pin the zero frame, no
   `onUpdate`-driven content). When measuring text on a render by hand, crop the WHOLE content
   box: a crop that starts below line 1 reads grain as "empty" and hid exactly this bug.
3d-2. **Readable-hold check (long-form):** for any graphic built to be READ (prompt, command,
   code, config, quote), count the frames on the render that carry the COMPLETE content — it must
   be **2-3s**. Budget the slot backwards (`reveal_end = duration − HOLD`), never forwards from
   the reveal. Measure neutral-bright TEXT pixels only: an accent cursor blinking through the hold
   makes a naive luma threshold report half the frames as incomplete. The reveal itself must be
   BURSTS (2-6 words, ~12 fps beat, punctuation doubles the hold — count discrete steps on the
   render; a new state every frame is the linear-wipe defect) and DETERMINISTIC (grep the comp:
   `Math.random` in a reveal is a defect — the headless render seeks).
3e. **Arrow GEOMETRY (long-form):** that heads are computed rather than typed is the gate's
   `source` check; whether they POINT correctly is yours. In the browser probe, read every `.head`
   back — including the clones inside a `#bloom` glow layer — and measure: the head's axis (tip
   minus base-midpoint) within **1°** of the path's end tangent, its base within **0.5×stroke-width**
   of the path end, every head vertex inside the SVG's viewBox. Straight arrows hide this bug — a
   hand-drawn head only reads broken on a curve — so measure the curved ones even when they look
   fine. Spec: `animations.md` § The arrow.
3f. **Footage-moves check (long-form):** the opening zoom-out is baked on clip 1 and every
   plan-marked emphasis beat has its push-in (`creative-moves.md` moves 5 and 6 carry the
   numbers). Read the **Transform** keys back — NOT Motion; a `Motion/Scale` query reports zero
   keys and reads as "no push-ins here". The 18-frame push-in must read **107.50** at frame 9,
   **100.66** at frame 4 and **114.34** at frame 14 (a linear bake reads 107.50 / 103.33 / 111.67,
   so frame 9 alone does not discriminate); the 18-frame quart zoom-out reads **100.94** at frame 9.
   Numbers: [preset README](../../../presets/youtube/default/README.md) § Emphasis push-in.
3g. **Borrowed-palette check:** any colour borrowed from a depicted product or brand must match a
   SAMPLE off the real asset (measure the render against the source logo/screenshot — e.g. Claude
   orange `#d97757` from the real logo file). A guessed brand hex is a defect
   (`default-overlay-style.md` § BORROWED PALETTES).
4. **Report:** built/placed counts, the `graphics-qa.py` summary line (green), the waivers with
   their reasons, the 2–3 frames as proof. Then step 5c: hand the draft to the **`edit-review`**
   polish loop (the gate, then two-dimension review rounds until zero verified defects) BEFORE
   presenting for review. The **live second
   pass** starts after that — iterate part-by-part (edit → re-render the one part →
   re-place/re-assemble), and on those tweak rounds skip the self-QA frame grabs: just edit,
   render, show — the fixes get called live from the review (a re-placed split part still gets
   § part splits' native seam proof). Respect a request to leave the timeline without exporting.

## Not this skill

Deciding graphics (step 5a: `graphics-plan`) · the color grade (pipeline step 4 — it runs BEFORE
this step and lives on the track UNDER the graphics; never fold it into the build) · background
music (the one conditional pass, not a numbered step) · SFX (pipeline step 6, after this
step and its defect loop: `workflows/sfx-plan.py` then the lane's placer) · audio of any kind (the polish is **pipeline step 3**, run right after the
cut lands on its finish surface, never during the build) · export (step 8, `finalize.sh`).
