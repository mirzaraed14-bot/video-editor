description: "The DaVinci Resolve finishing lane, counterpart to premiere-pro for Resolve users. Replays the rough-cut EDL (cuts.json) as separate trimmable clips on a real Resolve timeline via the davinci-resolve MCP, then keeps working through Resolve's official scripting API: silence-ripple auto cuts, AI subtitles + transcript-based cut proposals, Fusion node graphs, custom DCTL color shaders, in-app Python, vision metadata, native renders. Triggers: send to resolve, open in resolve, finish in resolve, davinci, edit this in resolve, resolve timeline."

# To DaVinci Resolve: Rough Cut Handoff + API Editing

The Resolve counterpart to the `premiere-pro` skill. Same job: get the cut **onto a Resolve timeline as separate, trimmable clips** by replaying the EDL (`transcript/cuts.json`) against the raw footage, then keep working there. Unlike Premiere there is **no bridge panel**: the `davinci-resolve` MCP talks to Resolve's official first-party scripting API in-process, which reaches four apps in one (Edit, Fusion, Color, Fairlight). Resolve must be RUNNING; `resolve_control launch` can start it (headless supported, but several AI features are GUI-only, noted below).

## 🔒 STEP INDEX — what this lane does at each pipeline step

**This skill carries HOW, never WHAT.** The look, the numbers and the definition of done for every
step live in the format's preset ([`presets/youtube/default/README.md`](../../../presets/youtube/default/README.md)
for long-form). Read the preset for the target, then the row below for the mechanics.
Cross-lane status: [`LANES.md`](../../../LANES.md).

| # | Step | On this lane | Where |
|---|------|--------------|-------|
| 1 | Intake | — universal, no Resolve involvement | CLAUDE.md § Pipeline |
| 2 | Rough cut → replay | ✅ scripted — ONE call rebuilds the EDL as trimmable clips | § Step 2 below |
| 3 | Audio polish | ✅ scripted — ffmpeg per source file + `ReplaceClip` (the API has NO audio-FX surface) | § Step 3 below → [`lanes/resolve/resolve-audio-polish/`](../../../lanes/resolve/resolve-audio-polish/README.md) |
| 4 | Color grade | ⚠️ separation validated, the house cube is NOT — read the section before assuming | § Step 4 below → [`lanes/resolve/resolve-grading/`](../../../lanes/resolve/resolve-grading/README.md) |
| 5 | Graphics | ✅ scripted — `AppendToTimeline` + Fusion Transform for moves | § Step 5 below |
| 6 | SFX | ⛔ plan only — [`LANES.md`](../../../LANES.md) § step 6 | [`presets/youtube/default/sfx.md`](../../../presets/youtube/default/sfx.md) |

| 8 | Export | ✅ scripted — the native render queue | § Step 8 below → [`lanes/resolve/resolve-export.md`](../../../lanes/resolve/resolve-export.md) |

⚠️ **Never carry a Premiere habit across.** The three that have actually shipped damage here:
hand-scaling a 1080 asset on a 4K timeline (Resolve already conformed it — Motion Scale 200 doubles
it to 400% and crops), premultiplying an alpha mov (Resolve wants STRAIGHT and auto-detects it), and
reaching for an adjustment layer (a color group is this lane's equivalent and needs no track shuffle).

## Wiring

- MCP = `davinci-resolve` in `.mcp.json` → pinned local clone at `vendor/davinci-resolve-mcp/` ([samuelgursky/davinci-resolve-mcp](https://github.com/samuelgursky/davinci-resolve-mcp) v2.72.0, commit `a9fd831`, update checks off; bump the pin deliberately). Compound server (`src/server.py`, 34 grouped tools; `--full` = 341 granular). Venv built by `python3 install.py --clients manual`.
- Fresh CLIENT machine: `./setup-resolve.sh` (ships at the root of the client package) clones the pin, builds the venv, and writes the `.mcp.json` entry with the three env vars (`RESOLVE_SCRIPT_API` / `RESOLVE_SCRIPT_LIB` / `PYTHONPATH`). In THIS repo it is already built at `vendor/davinci-resolve-mcp/` and wired in `.mcp.json` — there is no `./setup-resolve.sh` at the root.
- Resolve side: nothing to configure in the normal case: **External scripting = Local is Resolve's shipped default** (verified on multiple installs, 2026-08-13; don't tell users to go set it). Only if the MCP can't connect after a Claude Code restart, verify Preferences → System → General → External scripting = Local as a troubleshooting step. External scripting is a Studio feature; **the free edition runs through the MCP's in-app bridge, and `setup-resolve.sh` decides that at install time (2026-09-07):** it detects the edition, runs the vendored `scripts/install_resolve_bridge.py` (needs `PYTHONUTF8=1` on Windows; the script exports it), seeds the project root into the bridge's allow-lists, and bakes `DAVINCI_RESOLVE_BRIDGE=1` into the venv as a `.pth` (a flag added to `.mcp.json`'s `env` mid-session never reaches a server Claude Code respawns from its session-start snapshot). On a free-edition machine (the `.mcp.json` entry carries that flag) the user runs **Workspace → Scripts → resolve_bridge** after every Resolve start, with a project open; `BRIDGE_UNAVAILABLE` means it isn't running, and retrying cannot start it. The entry also caps every call at 10 minutes (`"timeout": 600000`), because a free edition wired the Studio way hung its first call for Claude Code's 30-minute idle timeout.
- Second server, NOT wired: `resolve-advanced/` (18 Node tools) edits `.drp`/`.drt`/`.drx` with Resolve closed. Its `.prproj` conform bridge extracted 0 editorial events from a real Premiere project, so don't rely on it.

## Project setup: MATCH THE SOURCE FPS, and never ask for a click

**Step zero of every Resolve job: `ffprobe` the raw and read its real frame rate.** The project must match the footage: 24 fps source gets a 24 fps project, 30 gets 30. Do not assume, and do not default to whatever the last job used.

**ffprobe is only the first read: after import, `GetClipProperty('FPS')` on the clip is the authority (iPhone VFR trap, measured 2026-08-13).** iPhone `.MOV` footage is variable frame rate: ffprobe's `r_frame_rate` reports `30000/1001` (29.97) while Resolve ingests the same clip at **30.00 native**, and a template + EDL conversion built on the 29.97 reading conformed every clip ÷1.001 and placed every cut ~0.5 s early. So: import the media, read `GetClipProperty('FPS')`, and let THAT decide both the template (iPhone footage gets `1080p30.drp`, **not** `1080p2997.drp`) and the EDL seconds→source-frames math; if the template guess was wrong, delete the project and rebuild at the right rate. **Diagnostic signature:** a uniform ÷1.001 (or ×1.001) pattern across every item's duration/left-offset readback means the fps model is wrong: rebuild, never nudge individual frames. (The ffmpeg/flat-render path is unaffected: ffmpeg trims by time, so `splice.sh`'s frame-snap at the ffprobe rate stays correct there.)

**Then clone a template `.drp` at that fps. Do NOT use `create_project` + `set_setting`.** A new project defaults to 3840x2160 / **24 fps**, and `timelinePlaybackFrameRate` (a *separate* setting from `timelineFrameRate`) cannot be written by the API at all. A 30 fps timeline left playing back at 24 produces **chopped, glitchy audio**. Importing a `.drp` restores fps + resolution wholesale, bypassing `SetSetting` entirely (verified 2026-08-04).

```python
pm = resolve.GetProjectManager
pm.SaveProject                                     # outgoing project, or a GUI modal blocks everything
pm.ImportProject('lanes/resolve/resolve-templates/1080p30.drp', '<Project Name>')
pm.LoadProject('<Project Name>')
p = pm.GetCurrentProject; mp = p.GetMediaPool; root = mp.GetRootFolder
mp.SetCurrentFolder(root)
tls = [p.GetTimelineByIndex(i) for i in range(1, p.GetTimelineCount+1)]
if tls: mp.DeleteTimelines(tls)                      # strip inherited content
if root.GetClipList: mp.DeleteClips(root.GetClipList)
```

**Always read `timelinePlaybackFrameRate` AND `timelineFrameRate` back** before building the timeline.

**One template per frame rate: a template cannot be re-pitched** (once a project carries a playback fps, `timelineFrameRate` goes read-only too). But minting a template at ANY rate is **fully scripted, zero clicks** (2026-08-04) — paths are taken as given, so pass them repo-relative:

```bash
uv run lanes/resolve/resolve-templates/mint-template.py \
  lanes/resolve/resolve-templates/1080p30.drp <fps> \
  lanes/resolve/resolve-templates/<out>.drp
```

Available now: 1080p30, 1080p2997 (both in [`lanes/resolve/resolve-templates/`](../../../lanes/resolve/resolve-templates/) — how the settings blob is patched, the verified rate-enum table and the anonymity check live in its README). Always import + read back both fps keys before trusting a fresh mint. 24 fps needs no template (a stock `create_project` is already 24/24, just set the resolution).

## Vertical (9:16) framing

A clip dropped on a 1080×1920 timeline arrives LETTERBOXED (project Input Scaling defaults to fit, and that setting is UI-only from the API). The fix is one property write, resolution-agnostic, no math:

```
item.SetProperty('Scaling', 3)   # 3 = scale full frame with crop = FILL at Zoom 1.0
```

Values: 0 = fit, 1 = center-crop-at-native, 2 = fit, 3 = FILL. Zoom math (`tl_h / (tl_w * src_h / src_w)`) is quality-identical (Resolve concatenates sizing transforms and resamples once), so prefer Scaling=3 for simplicity. 16:9 → 9:16 is a ~1.78x upscale from a 1080p source, inherent to the crop; shoot 4K for vertical (downscale instead). `SetClipProperty('Super Scale', N)` takes **bare ints only** (1=off, 2=2x, 3=3x); every string form returns False.

**Mixed-resolution assets: let Resolve conform, NEVER hand-scale (2026-08-05).** The project setting `timelineInputResMismatchBehavior` defaults to `scaleToFit`, so a 1080p asset (title card, alpha overlay, older footage) already fills a 4K frame on drop. The Premiere habit (Motion Scale 200) doubles that to 400% and crops the middle out, plausibly enough to ship: a title card lost its first and last letters. Leave `ZoomX`/`ZoomY` at 1.0, check the setting before scaling anything, and verify with a real render (clip-level readback reports whatever zoom it was told and hides the crop). Upside of the same conform: mixed fps lands frame-for-frame (a 29.97 clip on a 30.000 timeline keeps its frame count), so frame-indexed graphics and same-rate overlays stay in sync with no re-render.

## Step 2 — EDL replay: one call

Run the splice `RENDER=0` first (same rule as the Premiere path: never render the flat cut for an app finish). Then the whole rebuild is a single call:

1. **Create the project from a matching template (see § Project setup above). Never `create_project` + `set_setting`.** Match the template to the fps **Resolve ingests the clips at** (`GetClipProperty('FPS')` after import), not ffprobe's `r_frame_rate`; iPhone VFR footage differs between the two (trap in § Project setup above).
2. `media_pool create_timeline_from_clips` with `clip_infos` = `{clip_id, start_frame, end_frame, record_frame}` in **SOURCE frames at the fps Resolve ingested the clip at** (`GetClipProperty('FPS')`; see the iPhone VFR trap in § Project setup above). `end_frame` is **EXCLUSIVE** (dur = end − start; matched a real EDL 8/8 to the frame). `record_frame` is timeline-relative. Linked audio comes along automatically.
3. Verify with `timeline get_items_in_track` readback: starts sit on the 108000 = 01:00:00:00 offset.
   **When clip fps ≠ timeline fps, `GetLeftOffset` reads back in CONFORMED (timeline) frames while `start_frame` is consumed as NATIVE source frames**: a 29.97 clip on a 30 fps timeline reads back `native × 1.001`, which looks like a growing drift (up to 4 frames over 2.5 min) and is NOT one. Durations and `record_frame` read back exact, so verify those and don't "fix" the offsets. Resolve conforms by TIME, not 1:1 frames (measured: a 4612-native-frame span occupies 4616 timeline frames at 30 fps); that one probe settles the domain question in a single call.
4. `project_manager save` **immediately**. GUI mode + unsaved project = a modal no script can dismiss. (The `save` tool wrapper can return false while the raw call works; verify via `run_inline`, where `pm.SaveProject` returns True.)

### Do we still need WhisperX?

Yes, for the rough cut. Measured on the same clip: Resolve gives phrase-level cues (median ~1.9s / 6 words, timing only at cue edges, ~6x fewer anchors than WhisperX's per-word timestamps), and cue starts sit inside the very error band `refine-cuts.py` exists to fix. Keep the locked WhisperX rough-cut for cutting; Resolve's transcription is useful for long-form CC and machines without the venv.

## Step 3 — audio polish: ffmpeg on the source files + `ReplaceClip`, NOT the API

**The scripting API has zero audio-effects surface, and it is NOT a version thing, don't re-litigate** (no clip Volume/Pan, no track fader, no bus access, no FX insertion; the MCP's `get_audio`/`set_audio` query keys Resolve doesn't have). So this lane polishes the SOURCE FILES with ffmpeg and swaps the media under the locked timeline, rather than applying effects. The four independent corroborations and the ruled-out routes: the engineering archive.

**Run it immediately after the replay verifies — pipeline step 3 (2026-08-28), never per-section during the cut.** The pass is [`lanes/resolve/resolve-audio-polish/`](../../../lanes/resolve/resolve-audio-polish/README.md) (`normalize-sections.sh` then `replace-clips.py`), validated 2026-08-06 on 9 sections / 210 clips with zero clips moved. **Read that README before running one** — the chain, the drift gate and the `ReplaceClip` traps all live there. It swaps media, not clips, so every later hand edit rides on it; only a timeline REBUILD from re-imported raw needs the swap re-run.

Normalized files go in `audio/` or `audio-normalized/`, never `raw/`: `transcribe.sh` globs `raw/*.mov` and would transcribe them as extra clips on a `--force` re-run.

**To READ an audio pass someone made by hand, bounce and measure; the state is unreadable.** `get_audio`/`get_property` return nulls on audio items, and a `.drp` export hides mix state in opaque zstd blobs (per-item `EffectFiltersBA` are byte-identical defaults regardless of the mix). Instead `render prepare_render_job` a throwaway 480x270 mp4 (a 55s timeline rendered in 2.2s) and `volumedetect` each segment against the same source range in the raw: a uniform peak ceiling across every segment plus a gain delta that shrinks as the source gets louder = gain-into-limiter, and the numbers tell you the settings. Gotcha: `ExportVideo: false` produces a job with an empty VideoCodec and `StartRendering` then just returns False: render tiny video, not none. Clean up with `delete_all_jobs` + re-set format/codec (`GetRenderSettings` is unavailable here, so the tool's "before" snapshot is empty; track what you changed yourself).

## Step 4 — color grade (mechanism validated 2026-08-06: 9 clips, one shader)

**The mechanics are [`lanes/resolve/resolve-grading/`](../../../lanes/resolve/resolve-grading/README.md) — how a colour group is built and assigned, the DCTL dialect that compiles, the `install` vs `set_lut` staging trap, the teardown sweep, plus a reference shader and a numpy previewer. Read it before any grading work on this lane.** What follows is only what the preset asks for and which half of it is proven here.

### What the preset asks for, and what is proven here

**The universal contract is the SEPARATION: the footage carries the look, the graphics carry none of
it, established before a single graphic is placed.** On this lane that half is free and validated —
a colour group covers only its members. **The other half, replaying the house cube, is NOT validated.**

| Half of the step | Status here |
|---|---|
| Footage graded, graphics untouched | ✅ a color group covers only its members. Join the footage clips; leave the graphics track out. No track shuffle, no adjustment layer, no reordering. |
| A shared look across every footage clip | ✅ one node on the group's **post-clip** graph, `SetLUT(1, …)`. Proven with a DCTL. |
| The house `Autumn-Rec709.cube` specifically | ⚠️ **UNVALIDATED.** Mechanically it is the same `SetLUT` call with a `.cube` path instead of a `.dctl` (install into the user LUT dir, `project.RefreshLUTList`, then set it on the post-clip node). Nothing has run it. |
| Look Intensity 70 + Creative Saturation 115 | ⛔ **no equivalent through the API.** Those are Lumetri dials. `Graph` exposes LUT, label and enable and nothing else — no colour parameters at all. |

**So on this lane the look is reachable but the two dials are not.** Two honest routes, both a
first-run decision rather than a settled recipe:

1. **Fold the whole thing into one DCTL** — the cube's transform plus the intensity blend and the
   saturation lift, hardcoded, applied as the single post-clip node. That is what the DCTL path
   exists for, and it is the only way to get all three in one scripted node.
2. **Cube on the node, dials by hand** in the Color page, once, then saved as a group grade.

**Whichever route: verify with a real render, and say in the run report that the grade was
established by a different mechanism than the preset's Premiere recipe.** Never report "Autumn at
70/115 applied" on this lane unless you measured a frame — the numbers are Lumetri's, and a `.cube`
on a Resolve node is not the same signal chain.

⚠️ **A readback proves nothing here: verify from a real render.** `graph get_lut` reports the
wrapper's own record, not Resolve's state (it returned a LUT name for a node where in-process
`GetLUT(1)` read `None`, and the matching `set_lut` had also reported success).

## Step 5 — graphics on the timeline (validated 2026-08-05, 9 overlays on V2)

On a short-form preset the caption layer (`hf-graphics/captions/renders/captions-alpha.mov`, the
plan's `captions` cell) is one more straight-alpha overlay: append it on the highest video track,
spanning the whole cut, above every card ([`LANES.md`](../../../LANES.md) § step 5).

- **HyperFrames alpha ProRes 4444 drops in with ZERO alpha config: Resolve auto-detects `Alpha mode: Straight`**, exactly what hyperframes writes. **NEVER premultiply a Resolve-bound render.** Premultiply is the CapCut lane's fix; here it would blow out every soft pixel (motion blur, glows, fades).
- Placement is `AppendToTimeline` with `clipInfo` `{mediaPoolItem, startFrame: 0, endFrame: <frame count>, recordFrame: 108000 + start, trackIndex: 2, mediaType: 1}`. `endFrame` is **EXCLUSIVE**, `recordFrame` is **ABSOLUTE**. Script it idempotent and readback-verified.
- **`TimelineItem` has NO keyframe API** (only static `SetProperty` plus the Fusion methods), so an animated footage move is a Fusion comp on the clip: `AddFusionComp` → `add_tool Transform` → connect MediaIn→Transform→MediaOut → `add_keyframe` on `Size` (verified interpolating: 1.0→1.07 reads 1.035 mid-clip).
- Resolve's embedded Python opens files as **ASCII**: `io.open(..., encoding='utf-8')` everywhere, and keep em dashes out of timeline names (either one kills the script).
- Verify compositing from a real render.

## Step 8 — export: the native render queue

**Read [`lanes/resolve/resolve-export.md`](../../../lanes/resolve/resolve-export.md) before scripting a
DELIVERY render** — it owns the settings truth table, including why the Premiere CBR-50 lock does
not port here. Target (universal, from the preset): H.264 MP4 at the project's native resolution,
AAC 48 kHz, one clip, straight to `projects/<job>/outputs/<job>.final.mp4`.

Three facts to have before you open it: `SelectAllFrames` must be a real bool; MarkIn/MarkOut are
ABSOLUTE timeline frames (a 01:00:00:00 start means frame 86400 at 24 fps, not 0); and
`GetRenderSettings` is not callable on this build, so **verify the finished file with ffprobe**,
never a settings readback.


Then `./finalize.sh <job> --apply` for promotion + the `~/Downloads` copy (lane-agnostic).

## What the API can do (all readback-verified)

- **Auto rough-cut in-app: `edit_engine plan_silence_ripple` → `execute_silence_ripple`.** Validated end to end (75 lifts, 548.5s → 397.4s, mirrored audio items, original timeline untouched: it assembles a named VARIANT). Also reports keep-ranges too short to dissolve. **This is the working cut path; never `apply_cuts` (below).** For frame-exact word-level cuts, the house WhisperX rough-cut still wins (see below).
- **Text-based editing, read half:** `timeline_ai create_subtitles` (GUI only, ~57s for 9 min) → `timeline get_transcript` → `timeline propose_cuts` (dry-run proposals with kind/span/confidence/rationale for stammers, repeats, long pauses).
- **Fusion node graphs from the API:** `fusion_comp` add_tool / connect / set_input / add_keyframe, plus `bulk_set_expressions` for procedural animation. Scope arg must be nested: `timeline_item: {track_type, track_index, item_index}`, NOT flat.
- **Custom GPU color shaders + multi-clip grading:** author a DCTL, put it on a **color group's post-clip node**, and every member clip inherits it. Full playbook + gotchas: [`lanes/resolve/resolve-grading/`](../../../lanes/resolve/resolve-grading/README.md) — read it before any grading work. Short version: § Step 4 above.
- **Arbitrary Python inside Resolve:** `script_plugin run_inline` with `resolve` / `project` / `fusion` pre-bound. Hard 60s timeout; long ops go through the tool wrappers.
- **`timeline_versioning`** auto-archives before destructive ops (`<name>_archived_vNN` in Master/Archive) with rollback + diff. Rollback restores into a NEW `<name>_rolled_back_<hhmmss>` timeline.
- **Vision loop:** `media_analysis analyze_clip` extracts frames → Claude reads them → `commit_vision` writes Description/Comments/Keywords onto the clip + builds a SQLite FTS index.
- **Voice Isolation** writes at the TRACK level (`timeline set_voice_isolation_state`); the timeline_item version returns false.
- **Frame QA per clip only:** `timeline_markers get_thumbnail_image` returns the CURRENT CLIP's graded frame inline (GUI + Color page only), NOT the program composite: over a graphics track it shows the overlay on black and proves nothing. Fine for a single-track frame check; compositing and multi-track grades need a real render.
- Bin organization (`folder` / `media_pool`), markers, color groups, layout + keyboard presets, project settings: all live.

## Broken or dangerous: do not build on these

- **`timeline apply_cuts` DESTROYS the timeline while reporting success.** A "lift" deletes whole timeline ITEMS intersecting the span (it does not razor at boundaries); on a single-clip timeline the first lift deleted the entire clip, yet the tool reported `success: true, applied: 19`. Its claimed auto-archive did NOT happen (`_versioning.archived: false`). If it ever runs: never trust the applied count, read `results[].deleted` per cut, verify item counts after, and recover via `timeline_versioning rollback`. Use `execute_silence_ripple` or razor-based edits instead.
- **`SmartReframe`: the feature works, the API call does not.** The Inspector button fills the frame; the API call returns `success: true` and changes nothing, and there is no getter to even verify a UI reframe. Keep using `workflows/face-frame.py` for the measured 9:16 crop.
- `create_magic_mask` / `RegenerateMagicMask` return False in every mode, GUI included.
- `Stabilize` returns True but exposes no property to verify. Unverifiable through the API.
- `gallery_stills grab_and_export` **crashes the MCP server.** Use the two-step path: `timeline_ai grab_still` → `gallery_stills export_stills` (also drops a `.drx` of the grade).
- `Graph` has no AddNode: you can set LUTs/labels/enable on existing nodes but cannot create serial nodes. Workarounds: `ApplyGradeFromDRX` (a.drx carries a whole node tree, built once by hand or grabbed off a graded clip), a Fusion comp (`AddFusionComp` + `add_tool` — node creation IS exposed there), or fold the look into one DCTL.
- **`graph get_lut` reports the wrapper's own record, not Resolve's state (2026-08-06).** It returned a LUT name for a node where `GetLUT(1)` in-process read `None`; the matching `set_lut` had also reported success. Any grading readback must go through `script_plugin run_inline` against the real API objects, then be confirmed by a render.
- **`render start` returns `success: false` while the render runs fine.** `project.StartRendering([job_id])` returns `True` and produces the file — don't retry on the wrapper's false.
- `resolve_control` has **`open_page`, not `set_page`**; `resolve.RefreshLUTList` doesn't exist (it's `project.RefreshLUTList`).
- The scripting API cannot switch the Color page's node-graph level (Clip / Group Pre / Group Post / Timeline). Its whole UI surface is page switching + layout presets, so a session can build a group grade but cannot show it on screen — that dropdown is a hand-click.
- Bundled whisper.cpp transcription produced 0 segments; Resolve's own subtitle engine is the working path. Slate-clap sync detection false-positives on speech.

## Discipline

- **Target timelines by NAME, never `GetCurrentTimeline`,** whenever the user has the GUI open. They switch timelines while you work, and two writes have landed on the wrong timeline that way. Loop `GetTimelineByIndex` and match `GetName`.
- **Read back after every write** (same rule as the Premiere bridge): property writes return success generously; the readback is the truth.
- Getting the cut onto the timeline is where the handoff ends unless asked for more. The user's own editing happens in the app.
