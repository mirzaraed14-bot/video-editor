"""replace-clips.py — swap normalized audio under a LOCKED Resolve timeline, safely.

Runs INSIDE Resolve's embedded Python via the davinci-resolve MCP:

    script_plugin run_inline {language: py, source:
      "import io; JOB='/abs/path/to/projects/<job>'; "
      "exec(io.open('<abs>/replace-clips.py', encoding='utf-8').read())"}

Pass JOB in from the wrapper as above (or export RESOLVE_JOB before launching Resolve).
Expects normalized copies already rendered by normalize-sections.sh into
<JOB>/audio-normalized/, matched to media pool clips BY FILENAME.

WHY ReplaceClip AND NOT A RE-EDIT. The timeline references media pool CLIPS, not files, so
repointing a clip's media leaves every cut, trim, slip and hand edit exactly where it is.
That is what makes an audio pass safe to run on a timeline that has already been hand-cut —
which is the only time you should be running one.

WHY THE BEFORE/AFTER SNAPSHOT. "Nothing moved" is a claim, and on a 200-clip timeline nobody
can eyeball it. Every track's (name, start, duration) is captured before the swap and diffed
after; the pass is only correct if every track reports UNCHANGED.

REVERT. Each clip's original path is written to audio-normalized/REVERT.json as it is
replaced. To undo, run this file with REVERT = True.

Resolve's embedded Python opens files as ASCII — io.open(..., encoding='utf-8') everywhere.
