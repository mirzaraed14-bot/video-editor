# Closing only the project instead is no faster: with no project open Premiere drops the CEP
# panel, so the bridge dies either way and the relaunch is what brings it back.

# cannot switch the open project, so use --restart <project> to swap.

# Relies on the autostart patch in the CEP panel (bridge-cep.js, marked
# "REPO-PATCH: autostart") plus <StartOn> in CSXS/manifest.xml, which together
# load the panel and start the bridge when Premiere activates. If the panel is
# ever re-copied from vendor/premiere-mcp/cep-plugin/ those patches ride along,

# first (while it still answers), then a graceful quit, then WAIT. NEVER
# SIGTERM/SIGKILL (see the block below): Premiere logs any non-graceful exit as
# a crash, the crash dialog blocks the CEP panel next launch, and timeline state
# comes back subtly wrong. If it will not quit, stop and hand it to the user.
# Exact process NAME, not a path match: crashpad_handler and AdobeIPCBroker both carry the
# app path on their command lines and OUTLIVE a quit, so `pgrep -f <path>` kept reporting
# "still running" after Premiere was long gone and every graceful quit read as a failure
# (2026-09-02: the quit had worked, the save had landed, the script said it had not).
