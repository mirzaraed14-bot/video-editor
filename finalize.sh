# finalize.sh <job> — the EXPORT step. Make a finished job's outputs/ unambiguous.
#
# When a job is DONE, this promotes the real final render to ONE clear deliverable
# and retires the dead drafts — so there's never confusion about which file ships.
# It also drops a copy in ~/Downloads (the "export") so the finished file is ready to grab/upload.
# It does NOT nuke the job: everything you'd need to come back and re-edit is kept.
#
# The convention it enforces in projects/<job>/outputs/:
#   <job>.final.mp4         <- THE deliverable. Ship this. (promoted from the latest render)
#   <job>.mp4              <- clean base cut (re-edit / re-caption input) — KEPT
#   <job>.transcript.json  <- KEPT
# And it leaves the hf-graphics/ SOURCE (build.py, compositions/, parts.json, PROJECT.md)
# fully intact, so the whole graphics build can be reopened and tweaked later.
#
# It does NOT reclaim the heavy regenerable cache (renders/, work-* scratch). For that,
# run ./prune.sh --apply afterward. Together = a clean, shipped job.
#
# Default is a DRY RUN — it only reports the plan. Add --apply to actually do it.
#   ./finalize.sh <job>            # show the plan
#   ./finalize.sh <job> --apply    # promote the final + delete drafts
